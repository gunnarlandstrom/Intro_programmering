so
long
and
thanks
for
all
the
fish
the
hitch
hiker's
guide
to
the

for
jonny
brock
and
clare
gorst
and
all
other
arlingtonians
for
tea
sympathy
and
a
sofa
far
out
in
the
uncharted
backwaters
of
the
unfashionable
end
of
the
western
spiral
arm
of
the
galaxy
lies
a
small
unregarded
yellow
sun
orbiting
this
at
a
distance
of
roughly
ninetytwo
million
miles
is
an
utterly
insignificant
little
blue
green
planet
whose
ape
descended
life
forms
are
so
amazingly
primitive
that
they
still
think
digital
watches
are
a
pretty
neat
idea
this
planet
has
or
rather
had
a
problem
which
was
this
most
of
the
people
on
it
were
unhappy
for
pretty
much
of
the
time
many
solutions
were
suggested
for
this
problem
but
most
of
these
were
largely
concerned
with
the
movements
of
small
green
pieces
of
paper
which
is
odd
because
on
the
whole
it
wasn't
the
small
green
pieces
of
paper
that
were
unhappy
and
so
the
problem
remained
lots
of
the
people
were
mean
and
most
of
them
were
miserable
even
the
ones
with
digital
watches
many
were
increasingly
of
the
opinion
that
they'd
all
made
a
big
mistake
in
coming
down
from
the
trees
in
the
first
place
and
some
said
that
even
the
trees
had
been
a
bad
move
and
that
no
one
should
ever
have
left
the
oceans
and
then
one
thursday
nearly
two
thousand
years
after
one
man
had
been
nailed
to
a
tree
for
saying
how
great
it
would
be
to
be
nice
to
people
for
a
change
one
girl
sitting
on
her
own
in
a
small
cafe
in
rickmansworth
suddenly
realized
what
it
was
that
had
been
going
wrong
all
this
time
and
she
finally
knew
how
the
world
could
be
made
a
good
and
happy
place
this
time
it
was
right
it
would
work
and
no
one
would
have
to
get
nailed
to
anything
sadly
however
before
she
could
get
to
a
phone
to
tell
anyone
about
it
a
terribly
stupid
catastrophe
occurred
and
the
idea
was
lost
forever
this
is
not
her
story
but
it
is
the
story
of
that
terrible
stupid
catastrophe
and
some
of
its
consequences
it
is
also
the
story
of
a
book
a
book
called
the
hitch
hiker's
guide
to
the
galaxy
not
an
earth
book
never
published
on
earth
and
until
the
terrible
catastrophe
occurred
never
seen
or
heard
of
by
any
earthman
nevertheless
a
wholly
remarkable
book
in
fact
it
was
probably
the
most
remarkable
book
ever
to
come
out
of
the
great
publishing
houses
of
ursa
minor
of
which
no
earthman
had
ever
heard
either
not
only
is
it
a
wholly
remarkable
book
it
is
also
a
highly
successful
one
more
popular
than
the
celestial
home
care
omnibus
better
selling
than
fifty
more
things
to
do
in
zero
gravity
and
more
controversial
than
oolon
colluphid's
trilogy
of
philosophical
blockbusters
where
god
went
wrong
some
more
of
god's
greatest
mistakes
and
who
is
this
god
person
anyway
in
many
of
the
more
relaxed
civilizations
on
the
outer
eastern
rim
of
the
galaxy
the
hitch
hiker's
guide
has
already
supplanted
the
great
encyclopedia
galactica
as
the
standard
repository
of
all
knowledge
and
wisdom
for
though
it
has
many
omissions
and
contains
much
that
is
apocryphal
or
at
least
wildly
inaccurate
it
scores
over
the
older
more
pedestrian
work
in
two
important
respects
first
it
is
slightly
cheaper
and
secondly
it
has
the
words
don't
panic
inscribed
in
large
friendly
letters
on
its
cover
but
the
story
of
this
terrible
stupid
thursday
the
story
of
its
extraordinary
consequences
and
the
story
of
how
these
consequences
are
inextricably
intertwined
with
this
remarkable
book
begins
very
simply
it
begins
with
a
house
chapter
the
house
stood
on
a
slight
rise
just
on
the
edge
of
the
village
it
stood
on
its
own
and
looked
over
a
broad
spread
of
west
country
farmland
not
a
remarkable
house
by
any
means
it
was
about
thirty
years
old
squattish
squarish
made
of
brick
and
had
four
windows
set
in
the
front
of
a
size
and
proportion
which
more
or
less
exactly
failed
to
please
the
eye
the
only
person
for
whom
the
house
was
in
any
way
special
was
arthur
dent
and
that
was
only
because
it
happened
to
be
the
one
he
lived
in
he
had
lived
in
it
for
about
three
years
ever
since
he
had
moved
out
of
london
because
it
made
him
nervous
and
irritable
he
was
about
thirty
as
well
dark
haired
and
never
quite
at
ease
with
himself
the
thing
that
used
to
worry
him
most
was
the
fact
that
people
always
used
to
ask
him
what
he
was
looking
so
worried
about
he
worked
in
local
radio
which
he
always
used
to
tell
his
friends
was
a
lot
more
interesting
than
they
probably
thought
it
was
too
most
of
his
friends
worked
in
advertising
it
hadn't
properly
registered
with
arthur
that
the
council
wanted
to
knock
down
his
house
and
build
an
bypass
instead
at
eight
o'clock
on
thursday
morning
arthur
didn't
feel
very
good
he
woke
up
blearily
got
up
wandered
blearily
round
his
room
opened
a
window
saw
a
bulldozer
found
his
slippers
and
stomped
off
to
the
bathroom
to
wash
toothpaste
on
the
brush
so
scrub
shaving
mirror
pointing
at
the
ceiling
he
adjusted
it
for
a
moment
it
reflected
a
second
bulldozer
through
the
bathroom
window
properly
adjusted
it
reflected
arthur
dent's
bristles
he
shaved
them
off
washed
dried
and
stomped
off
to
the
kitchen
to
find
something
pleasant
to
put
in
his
mouth
kettle
plug
fridge
milk
coffee
yawn
the
word
bulldozer
wandered
through
his
mind
for
a
moment
in
search
of
something
to
connect
with
the
bulldozer
outside
the
kitchen
window
was
quite
a
big
one
he
stared
at
it
yellow
he
thought
and
stomped
off
back
to
his
bedroom
to
get
dressed
passing
the
bathroom
he
stopped
to
drink
a
large
glass
of
water
and
another
he
began
to
suspect
that
he
was
hung
over
why
was
he
hung
over
had
he
been
drinking
the
night
before
he
supposed
that
he
must
have
been
he
caught
a
glint
in
the
shaving
mirror
yellow
he
thought
and
stomped
on
to
the
bedroom
he
stood
and
thought
the
pub
he
thought
oh
dear
the
pub
he
vaguely
remembered
being
angry
angry
about
something
that
seemed
important
he'd
been
telling
people
about
it
telling
people
about
it
at
great
length
he
rather
suspected
his
clearest
visual
recollection
was
of
glazed
looks
on
other
people's
faces
something
about
a
new
bypass
he
had
just
found
out
about
it
had
been
in
the
pipeline
for
months
only
no
one
seemed
to
have
known
about
it
ridiculous
he
took
a
swig
of
water
it
would
sort
itself
out
he'd
decided
no
one
wanted
a
bypass
the
council
didn't
have
a
leg
to
stand
on
it
would
sort
itself
out
god
what
a
terrible
hangover
it
had
earned
him
though
he
looked
at
himself
in
the
wardrobe
mirror
he
stuck
out
his
tongue
yellow
he
thought
the
word
yellow
wandered
through
his
mind
in
search
of
something
to
connect
with
fifteen
seconds
later
he
was
out
of
the
house
and
lying
in
front
of
a
big
yellow
bulldozer
that
was
advancing
up
his
garden
path
mr
l
prosser
was
as
they
say
only
human
in
other
words
he
was
a
carbonbased
bipedal
life
form
descended
from
an
ape
more
specifically
he
was
forty
fat
and
shabby
and
worked
for
the
local
council
curiously
enough
though
he
didn't
know
it
he
was
also
a
direct
maleline
descendant
of
genghis
khan
though
intervening
generations
and
racial
mixing
had
so
juggled
his
genes
that
he
had
no
discernible
mongoloid
characteristics
and
the
only
vestiges
left
in
mr
l
prosser
of
his
mighty
ancestry
were
a
pronounced
stoutness
about
the
tum
and
a
predilection
for
little
fur
hats
he
was
by
no
means
a
great
warrior
in
fact
he
was
a
nervous
worried
man
today
he
was
particularly
nervous
and
worried
because
something
had
gone
seriously
wrong
with
his
job
which
was
to
see
that
arthur
dent's
house
got
cleared
out
of
the
way
before
the
day
was
out
come
off
it
mr
dent
he
said
you
can't
win
you
know
you
can't
lie
in
front
of
the
bulldozer
indefinitely
he
tried
to
make
his
eyes
blaze
fiercely
but
they
just
wouldn't
do
it
arthur
lay
in
the
mud
and
squelched
at
him
i'm
game
he
said
we'll
see
who
rusts
first
i'm
afraid
you're
going
to
have
to
accept
it
said
mr
prosser
gripping
his
fur
hat
and
rolling
it
round
the
top
of
his
head
this
bypass
has
got
to
be
built
and
it's
going
to
be
built
first
i've
heard
of
it
said
arthur
why's
it
going
to
be
built
mr
prosser
shook
his
finger
at
him
for
a
bit
then
stopped
and
put
it
away
again
what
do
you
mean
why's
it
got
to
be
built
he
said
it's
a
bypass
you've
got
to
build
bypasses
bypasses
are
devices
which
allow
some
people
to
drive
from
point
a
to
point
b
very
fast
whilst
other
people
dash
from
point
b
to
point
a
very
fast
people
living
at
point
c
being
a
point
directly
in
between
are
often
given
to
wonder
what's
so
great
about
point
a
that
so
many
people
of
point
b
are
so
keen
to
get
there
and
what's
so
great
about
point
b
that
so
many
people
of
point
a
are
so
keen
to
get
there
they
often
wish
that
people
would
just
once
and
for
all
work
out
where
the
hell
they
wanted
to
be
mr
prosser
wanted
to
be
at
point
d
point
d
wasn't
anywhere
in
particular
it
was
just
any
convenient
point
a
very
long
way
from
points
a
b
and
c
he
would
have
a
nice
little
cottage
at
point
d
with
axes
over
the
door
and
spend
a
pleasant
amount
of
time
at
point
e
which
would
be
the
nearest
pub
to
point
d
his
wife
of
course
wanted
climbing
roses
but
he
wanted
axes
he
didn't
know
why
he
just
liked
axes
he
flushed
hotly
under
the
derisive
grins
of
the
bulldozer
drivers
he
shifted
his
weight
from
foot
to
foot
but
it
was
equally
uncomfortable
on
each
obviously
somebody
had
been
appallingly
incompetent
and
he
hoped
to
god
it
wasn't
him
mr
prosser
said
you
were
quite
entitled
to
make
any
suggestions
or
protests
at
the
appropriate
time
you
know
appropriate
time
hooted
arthur
appropriate
time
the
first
i
knew
about
it
was
when
a
workman
arrived
at
my
home
yesterday
i
asked
him
if
he'd
come
to
clean
the
windows
and
he
said
no
he'd
come
to
demolish
the
house
he
didn't
tell
me
straight
away
of
course
oh
no
first
he
wiped
a
couple
of
windows
and
charged
me
a
fiver
then
he
told
me
but
mr
dent
the
plans
have
been
available
in
the
local
planning
office
for
the
last
nine
month
oh
yes
well
as
soon
as
i
heard
i
went
straight
round
to
see
them
yesterday
afternoon
you
hadn't
exactly
gone
out
of
your
way
to
call
attention
to
them
had
you
i
mean
like
actually
telling
anybody
or
anything
but
the
plans
were
on
display
on
display
i
eventually
had
to
go
down
to
the
cellar
to
find
them
that's
the
display
department
with
a
torch
ah
well
the
lights
had
probably
gone
so
had
the
stairs
but
look
you
found
the
notice
didn't
you
yes
said
arthur
yes
i
did
it
was
on
display
in
the
bottom
of
a
locked
filing
cabinet
stuck
in
a
disused
lavatory
with
a
sign
on
the
door
saying
beware
of
the
leopard
a
cloud
passed
overhead
it
cast
a
shadow
over
arthur
dent
as
he
lay
propped
up
on
his
elbow
in
the
cold
mud
it
cast
a
shadow
over
arthur
dent's
house
mr
prosser
frowned
at
it
it's
not
as
if
it's
a
particularly
nice
house
he
said
i'm
sorry
but
i
happen
to
like
it
you'll
like
the
bypass
oh
shut
up
said
arthur
dent
shut
up
and
go
away
and
take
your
bloody
bypass
with
you
you
haven't
got
a
leg
to
stand
on
and
you
know
it
mr
prosser's
mouth
opened
and
closed
a
couple
of
times
while
his
mind
was
for
a
moment
filled
with
inexplicable
but
terribly
attractive
visions
of
arthur
dent's
house
being
consumed
with
fire
and
arthur
himself
running
screaming
from
the
blazing
ruin
with
at
least
three
hefty
spears
protruding
from
his
back
mr
prosser
was
often
bothered
with
visions
like
these
and
they
made
him
feel
very
nervous
he
stuttered
for
a
moment
and
then
pulled
himself
together
mr
dent
he
said
hello
yes
said
arthur
some
factual
information
for
you
have
you
any
idea
how
much
damage
that
bulldozer
would
suffer
if
i
just
let
it
roll
straight
over
you
how
much
said
arthur
none
at
all
said
mr
prosser
and
stormed
nervously
off
wondering
why
his
brain
was
filled
with
a
thousand
hairy
horsemen
all
shouting
at
him
by
a
curious
coincidence
none
at
all
is
exactly
how
much
suspicion
the
apedescendant
arthur
dent
had
that
one
of
his
closest
friends
was
not
descended
from
an
ape
but
was
in
fact
from
a
small
planet
in
the
vicinity
of
betelgeuse
and
not
from
guildford
as
he
usually
claimed
arthur
dent
had
never
ever
suspected
this
this
friend
of
his
had
first
arrived
on
the
planet
some
fifteen
earth
years
previously
and
he
had
worked
hard
to
blend
himself
into
earth
society
with
it
must
be
said
some
success
for
instance
he
had
spent
those
fifteen
years
pretending
to
be
an
out
of
work
actor
which
was
plausible
enough
he
had
made
one
careless
blunder
though
because
he
had
skimped
a
bit
on
his
preparatory
research
the
information
he
had
gathered
had
led
him
to
choose
the
name
ford
prefect
as
being
nicely
inconspicuous
he
was
not
conspicuously
tall
his
features
were
striking
but
not
conspicuously
handsome
his
hair
was
wiry
and
gingerish
and
brushed
backwards
from
the
temples
his
skin
seemed
to
be
pulled
backwards
from
the
nose
there
was
something
very
slightly
odd
about
him
but
it
was
difficult
to
say
what
it
was
perhaps
it
was
that
his
eyes
didn't
blink
often
enough
and
when
you
talked
to
him
for
any
length
of
time
your
eyes
began
involuntarily
to
water
on
his
behalf
perhaps
it
was
that
he
smiled
slightly
too
broadly
and
gave
people
the
unnerving
impression
that
he
was
about
to
go
for
their
neck
he
struck
most
of
the
friends
he
had
made
on
earth
as
an
eccentric
but
a
harmless
one
an
unruly
boozer
with
some
oddish
habits
for
instance
he
would
often
gatecrash
university
parties
get
badly
drunk
and
start
making
fun
of
any
astrophysicist
he
could
find
till
he
got
thrown
out
sometimes
he
would
get
seized
with
oddly
distracted
moods
and
stare
into
the
sky
as
if
hypnotized
until
someone
asked
him
what
he
was
doing
then
he
would
start
guiltily
for
a
moment
relax
and
grin
oh
just
looking
for
flying
saucers
he
would
joke
and
everyone
would
laugh
and
ask
him
what
sort
of
flying
saucers
he
was
looking
for
green
ones
he
would
reply
with
a
wicked
grin
laugh
wildly
for
a
moment
and
then
suddenly
lunge
for
the
nearest
bar
and
buy
an
enormous
round
of
drinks
evenings
like
this
usually
ended
badly
ford
would
get
out
of
his
skull
on
whisky
huddle
into
a
corner
with
some
girl
and
explain
to
her
in
slurred
phrases
that
honestly
the
colour
of
the
flying
saucers
didn't
matter
that
much
really
thereafter
staggering
semiparalytic
down
the
night
streets
he
would
often
ask
passing
policemen
if
they
knew
the
way
to
betelgeuse
the
policemen
would
usually
say
something
like
don't
you
think
it's
about
time
you
went
off
home
sir
i'm
trying
to
baby
i'm
trying
to
is
what
ford
invariably
replied
on
these
occasions
in
fact
what
he
was
really
looking
out
for
when
he
stared
distractedly
into
the
night
sky
was
any
kind
of
flying
saucer
at
all
the
reason
he
said
green
was
that
green
was
the
traditional
space
livery
of
the
betelgeuse
trading
scouts
ford
prefect
was
desperate
that
any
flying
saucer
at
all
would
arrive
soon
because
fifteen
years
was
a
long
time
to
get
stranded
anywhere
particularly
somewhere
as
mindboggingly
dull
as
the
earth
ford
wished
that
a
flying
saucer
would
arrive
soon
because
he
knew
how
to
flag
flying
saucers
down
and
get
lifts
from
them
he
knew
how
to
see
the
marvels
of
the
universe
for
less
than
thirty
altairan
dollars
a
day
in
fact
ford
prefect
was
a
roving
researcher
for
that
wholly
remarkable
book
the
hitch
hiker's
guide
to
the
galaxy
human
beings
are
great
adaptors
and
by
lunchtime
life
in
the
environs
of
arthur's
house
had
settled
into
a
steady
routine
it
was
arthur's
accepted
role
to
lie
squelching
in
the
mud
making
occasional
demands
to
see
his
lawyer
his
mother
or
a
good
book
it
was
mr
prosser's
accepted
role
to
tackle
arthur
with
the
occasional
new
ploy
such
as
the
for
the
public
good
talk
the
march
of
progress
talk
the
they
knocked
my
house
down
once
you
know
never
looked
back
talk
and
various
other
cajoleries
and
threats
and
it
was
the
bulldozer
drivers
accepted
role
to
sit
around
drinking
coffee
and
experimenting
with
union
regulations
to
see
how
they
could
turn
the
situation
to
their
financial
advantage
the
earth
moved
slowly
in
its
diurnal
course
the
sun
was
beginning
to
dry
out
the
mud
arthur
lay
in
a
shadow
moved
across
him
again
hello
arthur
said
the
shadow
arthur
looked
up
and
squinting
into
the
sun
was
startled
to
see
ford
prefect
standing
above
him
ford
hello
how
are
you
fine
said
ford
look
are
you
busy
am
i
busy
exclaimed
arthur
well
i've
just
got
all
these
bulldozers
and
things
to
lie
in
front
of
because
they'll
knock
my
house
down
if
i
don't
but
other
than
that
well
no
not
especially
why
they
don't
have
sarcasm
on
betelgeuse
and
ford
prefect
often
failed
to
notice
it
unless
he
was
concentrating
he
said
good
is
there
anywhere
we
can
talk
what
said
arthur
dent
for
a
few
seconds
ford
seemed
to
ignore
him
and
stared
fixedly
into
the
sky
like
a
rabbit
trying
to
get
run
over
by
a
car
then
suddenly
he
squatted
down
beside
arthur
we've
got
to
talk
he
said
urgently
fine
said
arthur
talk
and
drink
said
ford
it's
vitally
important
that
we
talk
and
drink
now
we'll
go
to
the
pub
in
the
village
he
looked
into
the
sky
again
nervous
expectant
look
don't
you
understand
shouted
arthur
he
pointed
at
prosser
that
man
wants
to
knock
my
house
down
ford
glanced
at
him
puzzled
well
he
can
do
it
while
you're
away
can't
he
he
asked
but
i
don't
want
him
to
ah
look
what's
the
matter
with
you
ford
said
arthur
nothing
nothing's
the
matter
listen
to
me
i've
got
to
tell
you
the
most
important
thing
you've
ever
heard
i've
got
to
tell
you
now
and
i've
got
to
tell
you
in
the
saloon
bar
of
the
horse
and
groom
but
why
because
you
are
going
to
need
a
very
stiff
drink
ford
stared
at
arthur
and
arthur
was
astonished
to
find
that
his
will
was
beginning
to
weaken
he
didn't
realize
that
this
was
because
of
an
old
drinking
game
that
ford
learned
to
play
in
the
hyperspace
ports
that
served
the
madranite
mining
belts
in
the
star
system
of
orion
beta
the
game
was
not
unlike
the
earth
game
called
indian
wrestling
and
was
played
like
this
two
contestants
would
sit
either
side
of
a
table
with
a
glass
in
front
of
each
of
them
between
them
would
be
placed
a
bottle
of
janx
spirit
as
immortalized
in
that
ancient
orion
mining
song
oh
don't
give
me
none
more
of
that
old
janx
spirit
no
don't
you
give
me
none
more
of
that
old
janx
spirit
for
my
head
will
fly
my
tongue
will
lie
my
eyes
will
fry
and
i
may
die
won't
you
pour
me
one
more
of
that
sinful
old
janx
spirit
each
of
the
two
contestants
would
then
concentrate
their
will
on
the
bottle
and
attempt
to
tip
it
and
pour
spirit
into
the
glass
of
his
opponent
who
would
then
have
to
drink
it
the
bottle
would
then
be
refilled
the
game
would
be
played
again
and
again
once
you
started
to
lose
you
would
probably
keep
losing
because
one
of
the
effects
of
janx
spirit
is
to
depress
telepsychic
power
as
soon
as
a
predetermined
quantity
had
been
consumed
the
final
loser
would
have
to
perform
a
forfeit
which
was
usually
obscenely
biological
ford
prefect
usually
played
to
lose
ford
stared
at
arthur
who
began
to
think
that
perhaps
he
did
want
to
go
to
the
horse
and
groom
after
all
but
what
about
my
house
he
asked
plaintively
ford
looked
across
to
mr
prosser
and
suddenly
a
wicked
thought
struck
him
he
wants
to
knock
your
house
down
yes
he
wants
to
build
and
he
can't
because
you're
lying
in
front
of
the
bulldozers
yes
and
i'm
sure
we
can
come
to
some
arrangement
said
ford
excuse
me
he
shouted
mr
prosser
who
was
arguing
with
a
spokesman
for
the
bulldozer
drivers
about
whether
or
not
arthur
dent
constituted
a
mental
health
hazard
and
how
much
they
should
get
paid
if
he
did
looked
around
he
was
surprised
and
slightly
alarmed
to
find
that
arthur
had
company
yes
hello
he
called
has
mr
dent
come
to
his
senses
yet
can
we
for
the
moment
called
ford
assume
that
he
hasn't
well
sighed
mr
prosser
and
can
we
also
assume
said
ford
that
he's
going
to
be
staying
here
all
day
so
so
all
your
men
are
going
to
be
standing
around
all
day
doing
nothing
could
be
could
be
well
if
you're
resigned
to
doing
that
anyway
you
don't
actually
need
him
to
lie
here
all
the
time
do
you
what
you
don't
said
ford
patiently
actually
need
him
here
mr
prosser
thought
about
this
well
no
not
as
such
he
said
not
exactly
need
prosser
was
worried
he
thought
that
one
of
them
wasn't
making
a
lot
of
sense
ford
said
so
if
you
would
just
like
to
take
it
as
read
that
he's
actually
here
then
he
and
i
could
slip
off
down
to
the
pub
for
half
an
hour
how
does
that
sound
mr
prosser
thought
it
sounded
perfectly
potty
that
sounds
perfectly
reasonable
he
said
in
a
reassuring
tone
of
voice
wondering
who
he
was
trying
to
reassure
and
if
you
want
to
pop
off
for
a
quick
one
yourself
later
on
said
ford
we
can
always
cover
up
for
you
in
return
thank
you
very
much
said
mr
prosser
who
no
longer
knew
how
to
play
this
at
all
thank
you
very
much
yes
that's
very
kind
he
frowned
then
smiled
then
tried
to
do
both
at
once
failed
grasped
hold
of
his
fur
hat
and
rolled
it
fitfully
round
the
top
of
his
head
he
could
only
assume
that
he
had
just
won
so
continued
ford
prefect
if
you
would
just
like
to
come
over
here
and
lie
down
what
said
mr
prosser
ah
i'm
sorry
said
ford
perhaps
i
hadn't
made
myself
fully
clear
somebody's
got
to
lie
in
front
of
the
bulldozers
haven't
they
or
there
won't
be
anything
to
stop
them
driving
into
mr
dent's
house
will
there
what
said
mr
prosser
again
it's
very
simple
said
ford
my
client
mr
dent
says
that
he
will
stop
lying
here
in
the
mud
on
the
sole
condition
that
you
come
and
take
over
from
him
what
are
you
talking
about
said
arthur
but
ford
nudged
him
with
his
shoe
to
be
quiet
you
want
me
said
mr
prosser
spelling
out
this
new
thought
to
himself
to
come
and
lie
there
yes
in
front
of
the
bulldozer
yes
instead
of
mr
dent
yes
in
the
mud
in
as
you
say
it
the
mud
as
soon
as
mr
prosser
realized
that
he
was
substantially
the
loser
after
all
it
was
as
if
a
weight
lifted
itself
off
his
shoulders
this
was
more
like
the
world
as
he
knew
it
he
sighed
in
return
for
which
you
will
take
mr
dent
with
you
down
to
the
pub
that's
it
said
ford
that's
it
exactly
mr
prosser
took
a
few
nervous
steps
forward
and
stopped
promise
promise
said
ford
he
turned
to
arthur
come
on
he
said
to
him
get
up
and
let
the
man
lie
down
arthur
stood
up
feeling
as
if
he
was
in
a
dream
ford
beckoned
to
prosser
who
sadly
awkwardly
sat
down
in
the
mud
he
felt
that
his
whole
life
was
some
kind
of
dream
and
he
sometimes
wondered
whose
it
was
and
whether
they
were
enjoying
it
the
mud
folded
itself
round
his
bottom
and
his
arms
and
oozed
into
his
shoes
ford
looked
at
him
severely
and
no
sneaky
knocking
down
mr
dent's
house
whilst
he's
away
alright
he
said
the
mere
thought
growled
mr
prosser
hadn't
even
begun
to
speculate
he
continued
settling
himself
back
about
the
merest
possibility
of
crossing
my
mind
he
saw
the
bulldozer
driver's
union
representative
approaching
and
let
his
head
sink
back
and
closed
his
eyes
he
was
trying
to
marshal
his
arguments
for
proving
that
he
did
not
now
constitute
a
mental
health
hazard
himself
he
was
far
from
certain
about
this
his
mind
seemed
to
be
full
of
noise
horses
smoke
and
the
stench
of
blood
this
always
happened
when
he
felt
miserable
and
put
upon
and
he
had
never
been
able
to
explain
it
to
himself
in
a
high
dimension
of
which
we
know
nothing
the
mighty
khan
bellowed
with
rage
but
mr
prosser
only
trembled
slightly
and
whimpered
he
began
to
fell
little
pricks
of
water
behind
the
eyelids
bureaucratic
cockups
angry
men
lying
in
the
mud
indecipherable
strangers
handing
out
inexplicable
humiliations
and
an
unidentified
army
of
horsemen
laughing
at
him
in
his
head
what
a
day
what
a
day
ford
prefect
knew
that
it
didn't
matter
a
pair
of
dingo's
kidneys
whether
arthur's
house
got
knocked
down
or
not
now
arthur
remained
very
worried
but
can
we
trust
him
he
said
myself
i'd
trust
him
to
the
end
of
the
earth
said
ford
oh
yes
said
arthur
and
how
far's
that
about
twelve
minutes
away
said
ford
come
on
i
need
a
drink
chapter
here's
what
the
encyclopedia
galactica
has
to
say
about
alcohol
it
says
that
alcohol
is
a
colourless
volatile
liquid
formed
by
the
fermentation
of
sugars
and
also
notes
its
intoxicating
effect
on
certain
carbonbased
life
forms
the
hitch
hiker's
guide
to
the
galaxy
also
mentions
alcohol
it
says
that
the
best
drink
in
existence
is
the
pan
galactic
gargle
blaster
it
says
that
the
effect
of
a
pan
galactic
gargle
blaster
is
like
having
your
brains
smashed
out
by
a
slice
of
lemon
wrapped
round
a
large
gold
brick
the
guide
also
tells
you
on
which
planets
the
best
pan
galactic
gargle
blasters
are
mixed
how
much
you
can
expect
to
pay
for
one
and
what
voluntary
organizations
exist
to
help
you
rehabilitate
afterwards
the
guide
even
tells
you
how
you
can
mix
one
yourself
take
the
juice
from
one
bottle
of
that
ol
janx
spirit
it
says
pour
into
it
one
measure
of
water
from
the
seas
of
santraginus
v
oh
that
santraginean
sea
water
it
says
oh
those
santraginean
fish
allow
three
cubes
of
arcturan
megagin
to
melt
into
the
mixture
it
must
be
properly
iced
or
the
benzine
is
lost
allow
four
litres
of
fallian
marsh
gas
to
bubble
through
it
in
memory
of
all
those
happy
hikers
who
have
died
of
pleasure
in
the
marshes
of
fallia
over
the
back
of
a
silver
spoon
float
a
measure
of
qualactin

very
carefully
the

galactica
six
pints
of
bitter
said
ford
prefect
to
the
barman
of
the
horse
and
groom
and
quickly
please
the
world's
about
to
end
the
barman
of
the
horse
and
groom
didn't
deserve
this
sort
of
treatment
he
was
a
dignified
old
man
he
pushed
his
glasses
up
his
nose
and
blinked
at
ford
prefect
ford
ignored
him
and
stared
out
of
the
window
so
the
barman
looked
instead
at
arthur
who
shrugged
helplessly
and
said
nothing
so
the
barman
said
oh
yes
sir
nice
weather
for
it
and
started
pulling
pints
he
tried
again
going
to
watch
the
match
this
afternoon
then
ford
glanced
round
at
him
no
no
point
he
said
and
looked
back
out
of
the
window
what's
that
foregone
conclusion
then
you
reckon
sir
said
the
barman
arsenal
without
a
chance
no
no
said
ford
it's
just
that
the
world's
about
to
end
oh
yes
sir
so
you
said
said
the
barman
looking
over
his
glasses
this
time
at
arthur
lucky
escape
for
arsenal
if
it
did
ford
looked
back
at
him
genuinely
surprised
no
not
really
he
said
he
frowned
the
barman
breathed
in
heavily
there
you
are
sir
six
pints
he
said
arthur
smiled
at
him
wanly
and
shrugged
again
he
turned
and
smiled
wanly
at
the
rest
of
the
pub
just
in
case
any
of
them
had
heard
what
was
going
on
none
of
them
had
and
none
of
them
could
understand
what
he
was
smiling
at
them
for
a
man
sitting
next
to
ford
at
the
bar
looked
at
the
two
men
looked
at
the
six
pints
did
a
swift
burst
of
mental
arithmetic
arrived
at
an
answer
he
liked
and
grinned
a
stupid
hopeful
grin
at
them
get
off
said
ford
they're
ours
giving
him
a
look
that
would
have
an
algolian
suntiger
get
on
with
what
it
was
doing
ford
slapped
a
fivepound
note
on
the
bar
he
said
keep
the
change
what
from
a
fiver
thank
you
sir
you've
got
ten
minutes
left
to
spend
it
the
barman
simply
decided
to
walk
away
for
a
bit
ford
said
arthur
would
you
please
tell
me
what
the
hell
is
going
on
drink
up
said
ford
you've
got
three
pints
to
get
through
three
pints
said
arthur
at
lunchtime
the
man
next
to
ford
grinned
and
nodded
happily
ford
ignored
him
he
said
time
is
an
illusion
lunchtime
doubly
so
very
deep
said
arthur
you
should
send
that
in
to
the
reader's
digest
they've
got
a
page
for
people
like
you
drink
up
why
three
pints
all
of
a
sudden
muscle
relaxant
you'll
need
it
muscle
relaxant
muscle
relaxant
arthur
stared
into
his
beer
did
i
do
anything
wrong
today
he
said
or
has
the
world
always
been
like
this
and
i've
been
too
wrapped
up
in
myself
to
notice
alright
said
ford
i'll
try
to
explain
how
long
have
we
known
each
other
how
long
arthur
thought
er
about
five
years
maybe
six
he
said
most
of
it
seemed
to
make
some
sense
at
the
time
alright
said
ford
how
would
you
react
if
i
said
that
i'm
not
from
guildford
after
all
but
from
a
small
planet
somewhere
in
the
vicinity
of
betelgeuse
arthur
shrugged
in
a
soso
sort
of
way
i
don't
know
he
said
taking
a
pull
of
beer
why
do
you
think
it's
the
sort
of
thing
you're
likely
to
say
ford
gave
up
it
really
wasn't
worth
bothering
at
the
moment
what
with
the
world
being
about
to
end
he
just
said
drink
up
he
added
perfectly
factually
the
world's
about
to
end
arthur
gave
the
rest
of
the
pub
another
wan
smile
the
rest
of
the
pub
frowned
at
him
a
man
waved
at
him
to
stop
smiling
at
them
and
mind
his
own
business
this
must
be
thursday
said
arthur
musing
to
himself
sinking
low
over
his
beer
i
never
could
get
the
hang
of
thursdays
chapter
on
this
particular
thursday
something
was
moving
quietly
through
the
ionosphere
many
miles
above
the
surface
of
the
planet
several
somethings
in
fact
several
dozen
huge
yellow
chunky
slablike
somethings
huge
as
office
buildings
silent
as
birds
they
soared
with
ease
basking
in
electromagnetic
rays
from
the
star
sol
biding
their
time
grouping
preparing
the
planet
beneath
them
was
almost
perfectly
oblivious
of
their
presence
which
was
just
how
they
wanted
it
for
the
moment
the
huge
yellow
somethings
went
unnoticed
at
goonhilly
they
passed
over
cape
canaveral
without
a
blip
woomera
and
jodrell
bank
looked
straight
through
them
which
was
a
pity
because
it
was
exactly
the
sort
of
thing
they'd
been
looking
for
all
these
years
the
only
place
they
registered
at
all
was
on
a
small
black
device
called
a
subetha
sensomatic
which
winked
away
quietly
to
itself
it
nestled
in
the
darkness
inside
a
leather
satchel
which
ford
prefect
wore
habitually
round
his
neck
the
contents
of
ford
prefect's
satchel
were
quite
interesting
in
fact
and
would
have
made
any
earth
physicist's
eyes
pop
out
of
his
head
which
is
why
he
always
concealed
them
by
keeping
a
couple
of
dogeared
scripts
for
plays
he
pretended
he
was
auditioning
for
stuffed
in
the
top
besides
the
subetha
sensomatic
and
the
scripts
he
had
an
electronic
thumb
a
short
squat
black
rod
smooth
and
matt
with
a
couple
of
flat
switches
and
dials
at
one
end
he
also
had
a
device
which
looked
rather
like
a
largish
electronic
calculator
this
had
about
a
hundred
tiny
flat
press
buttons
and
a
screen
about
four
inches
square
on
which
any
one
of
a
million
pages
could
be
summoned
at
a
moment's
notice
it
looked
insanely
complicated
and
this
was
one
of
the
reasons
why
the
snug
plastic
cover
it
fitted
into
had
the
words
don't
panic
printed
on
it
in
large
friendly
letters
the
other
reason
was
that
this
device
was
in
fact
that
most
remarkable
of
all
books
ever
to
come
out
of
the
great
publishing
corporations
of
ursa
minor
the
hitch
hiker's
guide
to
the
galaxy
the
reason
why
it
was
published
in
the
form
of
a
micro
sub
meson
electronic
component
is
that
if
it
were
printed
in
normal
book
form
an
interstellar
hitch
hiker
would
require
several
inconveniently
large
buildings
to
carry
it
around
in
beneath
that
in
ford
prefect's
satchel
were
a
few
biros
a
notepad
and
a
largish
bath
towel
from
marks
and
spencer
the
hitch
hiker's
guide
to
the
galaxy
has
a
few
things
to
say
on
the
subject
of
towels
a
towel
it
says
is
about
the
most
massively
useful
thing
an
interstellar
hitch
hiker
can
have
partly
it
has
great
practical
value
you
can
wrap
it
around
you
for
warmth
as
you
bound
across
the
cold
moons
of
jaglan
beta
you
can
lie
on
it
on
the
brilliant
marblesanded
beaches
of
santraginus
v
inhaling
the
heady
sea
vapours
you
can
sleep
under
it
beneath
the
stars
which
shine
so
redly
on
the
desert
world
of
kakrafoon
use
it
to
sail
a
mini
raft
down
the
slow
heavy
river
moth
wet
it
for
use
in
handto
handcombat
wrap
it
round
your
head
to
ward
off
noxious
fumes
or
to
avoid
the
gaze
of
the
ravenous
bugblatter
beast
of
traal
a
mindboggingly
stupid
animal
it
assumes
that
if
you
can't
see
it
it
can't
see
you
daft
as
a
bush
but
very
ravenous
you
can
wave
your
towel
in
emergencies
as
a
distress
signal
and
of
course
dry
yourself
off
with
it
if
it
still
seems
to
be
clean
enough
more
importantly
a
towel
has
immense
psychological
value
for
some
reason
if
a
strag
strag
nonhitch
hiker
discovers
that
a
hitch
hiker
has
his
towel
with
him
he
will
automatically
assume
that
he
is
also
in
possession
of
a
toothbrush
face
flannel
soap
tin
of
biscuits
flask
compass
map
ball
of
string
gnat
spray
wet
weather
gear
space
suit
etc
etc
furthermore
the
strag
will
then
happily
lend
the
hitch
hiker
any
of
these
or
a
dozen
other
items
that
the
hitch
hiker
might
accidentally
have
lost
what
the
strag
will
think
is
that
any
man
who
can
hitch
the
length
and
breadth
of
the
galaxy
rough
it
slum
it
struggle
against
terrible
odds
win
through
and
still
knows
where
his
towel
is
is
clearly
a
man
to
be
reckoned
with
hence
a
phrase
which
has
passed
into
hitch
hiking
slang
as
in
hey
you
sass
that
hoopy
ford
prefect
there's
a
frood
who
really
knows
where
his
towel
is
sass
know
be
aware
of
meet
have
sex
with
hoopy
really
together
guy
frood
really
amazingly
together
guy
nestling
quietly
on
top
of
the
towel
in
ford
prefect's
satchel
the
subetha
sensomatic
began
to
wink
more
quickly
miles
above
the
surface
of
the
planet
the
huge
yellow
somethings
began
to
fan
out
at
jodrell
bank
someone
decided
it
was
time
for
a
nice
relaxing
cup
of
tea
you
got
a
towel
with
you
said
ford
prefect
suddenly
to
arthur
arthur
struggling
through
his
third
pint
looked
round
at
him
why
what
no
should
i
have
he
had
given
up
being
surprised
there
didn't
seem
to
be
any
point
any
longer
ford
clicked
his
tongue
in
irritation
drink
up
he
urged
at
that
moment
the
dull
sound
of
a
rumbling
crash
from
outside
filtered
through
the
low
murmur
of
the
pub
through
the
sound
of
the
jukebox
through
the
sound
of
the
man
next
to
ford
hiccupping
over
the
whisky
ford
had
eventually
bought
him
arthur
choked
on
his
beer
leapt
to
his
feet
what's
that
he
yelped
don't
worry
said
ford
they
haven't
started
yet
thank
god
for
that
said
arthur
and
relaxed
it's
probably
just
your
house
being
knocked
down
said
ford
drowning
his
last
pint
what
shouted
arthur
suddenly
ford's
spell
was
broken
arthur
looked
wildly
around
him
and
ran
to
the
window
my
god
they
are
they're
knocking
my
house
down
what
the
hell
am
i
doing
in
the
pub
ford
it
hardly
makes
any
difference
at
this
stage
said
ford
let
them
have
their
fun
fun
yelped
arthur
fun
he
quickly
checked
out
of
the
window
again
that
they
were
talking
about
the
same
thing
damn
their
fun
he
hooted
and
ran
out
of
the
pub
furiously
waving
a
nearly
empty
beer
glass
he
made
no
friends
at
all
in
the
pub
that
lunchtime
stop
you
vandals
you
home
wreckers
bawled
arthur
you
half
crazed
visigoths
stop
will
you
ford
would
have
to
go
after
him
turning
quickly
to
the
barman
he
asked
for
four
packets
of
peanuts
there
you
are
sir
said
the
barman
slapping
the
packets
on
the
bar
twentyeight
pence
if
you'd
be
so
kind
ford
was
very
kind
he
gave
the
barman
another
fivepound
note
and
told
him
to
keep
the
change
the
barman
looked
at
it
and
then
looked
at
ford
he
suddenly
shivered
he
experienced
a
momentary
sensation
that
he
didn't
understand
because
no
one
on
earth
had
ever
experienced
it
before
in
moments
of
great
stress
every
life
form
that
exists
gives
out
a
tiny
sublimal
signal
this
signal
simply
communicates
an
exact
and
almost
pathetic
sense
of
how
far
that
being
is
from
the
place
of
his
birth
on
earth
it
is
never
possible
to
be
further
than
sixteen
thousand
miles
from
your
birthplace
which
really
isn't
very
far
so
such
signals
are
too
minute
to
be
noticed
ford
prefect
was
at
this
moment
under
great
stress
and
he
was
born
light
years
away
in
the
near
vicinity
of
betelgeuse
the
barman
reeled
for
a
moment
hit
by
a
shocking
incomprehensible
sense
of
distance
he
didn't
know
what
it
meant
but
he
looked
at
ford
prefect
with
a
new
sense
of
respect
almost
awe
are
you
serious
sir
he
said
in
a
small
whisper
which
had
the
effect
of
silencing
the
pub
you
think
the
world's
going
to
end
yes
said
ford
but
this
afternoon
ford
had
recovered
himself
he
was
at
his
flippest
yes
he
said
gaily
in
less
than
two
minutes
i
would
estimate
the
barman
couldn't
believe
the
conversation
he
was
having
but
he
couldn't
believe
the
sensation
he
had
just
had
either
isn't
there
anything
we
can
do
about
it
then
he
said
no
nothing
said
ford
stuffing
the
peanuts
into
his
pockets
someone
in
the
hushed
bar
suddenly
laughed
raucously
at
how
stupid
everyone
had
become
the
man
sitting
next
to
ford
was
a
bit
sozzled
by
now
his
eyes
waved
their
way
up
to
ford
i
thought
he
said
that
if
the
world
was
going
to
end
we
were
meant
to
lie
down
or
put
a
paper
bag
over
our
head
or
something
if
you
like
yes
said
ford
that's
what
they
told
us
in
the
army
said
the
man
and
his
eyes
began
the
long
trek
back
down
to
his
whisky
will
that
help
asked
the
barman
no
said
ford
and
gave
him
a
friendly
smile
excuse
me
he
said
i've
got
to
go
with
a
wave
he
left
the
pub
was
silent
for
a
moment
longer
and
then
embarrassingly
enough
the
man
with
the
raucous
laugh
did
it
again
the
girl
he
had
dragged
along
to
the
pub
with
him
had
grown
to
loathe
him
dearly
over
the
last
hour
or
so
and
it
would
probably
have
been
a
great
satisfaction
to
her
to
know
that
in
a
minute
and
a
half
or
so
he
would
suddenly
evaporate
into
a
whiff
of
hydrogen
ozone
and
carbon
monoxide
however
when
the
moment
came
she
would
be
too
busy
evaporating
herself
to
notice
it
the
barman
cleared
his
throat
he
heard
himself
say
last
orders
please
the
huge
yellow
machines
began
to
sink
downward
and
to
move
faster
ford
knew
they
were
there
this
wasn't
the
way
he
had
wanted
it
running
up
the
lane
arthur
had
nearly
reached
his
house
he
didn't
notice
how
cold
it
had
suddenly
become
he
didn't
notice
the
wind
he
didn't
notice
the
sudden
irrational
squall
of
rain
he
didn't
notice
anything
but
the
caterpillar
bulldozers
crawling
over
the
rubble
that
had
been
his
home
you
barbarians
he
yelled
i'll
sue
the
council
for
every
penny
it's
got
i'll
have
you
hung
drawn
and
quartered
and
whipped
and
boiled
until
until
until
you've
had
enough
ford
was
running
after
him
very
fast
very
very
fast
and
then
i'll
do
it
again
yelled
arthur
and
when
i've
finished
i
will
take
all
the
little
bits
and
i
will
jump
on
them
arthur
didn't
notice
that
the
men
were
running
from
the
bulldozers
he
didn't
notice
that
mr
prosser
was
staring
hectically
into
the
sky
what
mr
prosser
had
noticed
was
that
huge
yellow
somethings
were
screaming
through
the
clouds
impossibly
huge
yellow
somethings
and
i
will
carry
on
jumping
on
them
yelled
arthur
still
running
until
i
get
blisters
or
i
can
think
of
anything
even
more
unpleasant
to
do
and
then
arthur
tripped
and
fell
headlong
rolled
and
landed
flat
on
his
back
at
last
he
noticed
that
something
was
going
on
his
finger
shot
upwards
what
the
hell's
that
he
shrieked
whatever
it
was
raced
across
the
sky
in
monstrous
yellowness
tore
the
sky
apart
with
mindbuggering
noise
and
leapt
off
into
the
distance
leaving
the
gaping
air
to
shut
behind
it
with
a
bang
that
drove
your
ears
six
feet
into
your
skull
another
one
followed
and
did
the
same
thing
only
louder
it's
difficult
to
say
exactly
what
the
people
on
the
surface
of
the
planet
were
doing
now
because
they
didn't
really
know
what
they
were
doing
themselves
none
of
it
made
a
lot
of
sense
running
into
houses
running
out
of
houses
howling
noiselessly
at
the
noise
all
around
the
world
city
streets
exploded
with
people
cars
slewed
into
each
other
as
the
noise
fell
on
them
and
then
rolled
off
like
a
tidal
wave
over
hills
and
valleys
deserts
and
oceans
seeming
to
flatten
everything
it
hit
only
one
man
stood
and
watched
the
sky
stood
with
terrible
sadness
in
his
eyes
and
rubber
bungs
in
his
ears
he
knew
exactly
what
was
happening
and
had
known
ever
since
his
subetha
senso
matic
had
started
winking
in
the
dead
of
night
beside
his
pillar
and
woken
him
with
a
start
it
was
what
he
had
waited
for
all
these
years
but
when
he
had
deciphered
the
signal
pattern
sitting
alone
in
his
small
dark
room
a
coldness
had
gripped
him
and
squeezed
his
heart
of
all
the
races
in
all
of
the
galaxy
who
could
have
come
and
said
a
big
hello
to
planet
earth
he
thought
didn't
it
just
have
to
be
the
vogons
still
he
knew
what
he
had
to
do
as
the
vogon
craft
screamed
through
the
air
high
above
him
he
opened
his
satchel
he
threw
away
a
copy
of
joseph
and
the
amazing
technicolor
dreamcoat
he
threw
away
a
copy
of
godspell
he
wouldn't
need
them
where
he
was
going
everything
was
ready
everything
was
prepared
he
knew
where
his
towel
was
a
sudden
silence
hit
the
earth
if
anything
it
was
worse
than
the
noise
for
a
while
nothing
happened
the
great
ships
hung
motionless
in
the
air
over
every
nation
on
earth
motionless
they
hung
huge
heavy
steady
in
the
sky
a
blasphemy
against
nature
many
people
went
straight
into
shock
as
their
minds
tried
to
encompass
what
they
were
looking
at
the
ships
hung
in
the
sky
in
much
the
same
way
that
bricks
don't
and
still
nothing
happened
then
there
was
a
slight
whisper
a
sudden
spacious
whisper
of
open
ambient
sound
every
hi
fi
set
in
the
world
every
radio
every
television
every
cassette
recorder
every
woofer
every
tweeter
every
midrange
driver
in
the
world
quietly
turned
itself
on
every
tin
can
every
dust
bin
every
window
every
car
every
wine
glass
every
sheet
of
rusty
metal
became
activated
as
an
acoustically
perfect
sounding
board
before
the
earth
passed
away
it
was
going
to
be
treated
to
the
very
ultimate
in
sound
reproduction
the
greatest
public
address
system
ever
built
but
there
was
no
concert
no
music
no
fanfare
just
a
simple
message
people
of
earth
your
attention
please
a
voice
said
and
it
was
wonderful
wonderful
perfect
quadrophonic
sound
with
distortion
levels
so
low
as
to
make
a
brave
man
weep
this
is
prostetnic
vogon
jeltz
of
the
galactic
hyperspace
planning
council
the
voice
continued
as
you
will
no
doubt
be
aware
the
plans
for
development
of
the
outlying
regions
of
the
galaxy
require
the
building
of
a
hyperspatial
express
route
through
your
star
system
and
regrettably
your
planet
is
one
of
those
scheduled
for
demolition
the
process
will
take
slightly
less
that
two
of
your
earth
minutes
thank
you
the
pa
died
away
uncomprehending
terror
settled
on
the
watching
people
of
earth
the
terror
moved
slowly
through
the
gathered
crowds
as
if
they

beneath

panic
sprouted
again
desperate
fleeing
panic
but
there
was
nowhere
to
flee
to
observing
this
the
vogons
turned
on
their
pa
again
it
said
there's
no
point
in
acting
all
surprised
about
it
all
the
planning
charts
and
demolition
orders
have
been
on
display
in
your
local
planning
department
on
alpha
centauri
for
fifty
of
your
earth
years
so
you've
had
plenty
of
time
to
lodge
any
formal
complaint
and
it's
far
too
late
to
start
making
a
fuss
about
it
now
the
pa
fell
silent
again
and
its
echo
drifted
off
across
the
land
the
huge
ships
turned
slowly
in
the
sky
with
easy
power
on
the
underside
of
each
a
hatchway
opened
an
empty
black
space
by
this
time
somebody
somewhere
must
have
manned
a
radio
transmitter
located
a
wavelength
and
broadcasted
a
message
back
to
the
vogon
ships
to
plead
on
behalf
of
the
planet
nobody
ever
heard
what
they
said
they
only
heard
the
reply
the
pa
slammed
back
into
life
again
the
voice
was
annoyed
it
said
what
do
you
mean
you've
never
been
to
alpha
centauri
for
heaven's
sake
mankind
it's
only
four
light
years
away
you
know
i'm
sorry
but
if
you
can't
be
bothered
to
take
an
interest
in
local
affairs
that's
your
own
lookout
energize
the
demolition
beams
light
poured
out
into
the
hatchways
i
don't
know
said
the
voice
on
the
pa
apathetic
bloody
planet
i've
no
sympathy
at
all
it
cut
off
there
was
a
terrible
ghastly
silence
there
was
a
terrible
ghastly
noise
there
was
a
terrible
ghastly
silence
the
vogon
constructor
fleet
coasted
away
into
the
inky
starry
void
chapter
far
away
on
the
opposite
spiral
arm
of
the
galaxy
five
hundred
thousand
light
years
from
the
star
sol
zaphod
beeblebrox
president
of
the
imperial
galactic
government
sped
across
the
seas
of
damogran
his
ion
drive
delta
boat
winking
and
flashing
in
the
damogran
sun
damogran
the
hot
damogran
the
remote
damogran
the
almost
totally
unheard
of
damogran
secret
home
of
the
heart
of
gold
the
boat
sped
on
across
the
water
it
would
be
some
time
before
it
reached
its
destination
because
damogran
is
such
an
inconveniently
arranged
planet
it
consists
of
nothing
but
middling
to
large
desert
islands
separated
by
very
pretty
but
annoyingly
wide
stretches
of
ocean
the
boat
sped
on
because
of
this
topological
awkwardness
damogran
has
always
remained
a
deserted
planet
this
is
why
the
imperial
galactic
government
chose
damogran
for
the
heart
of
gold
project
because
it
was
so
deserted
and
the
heart
of
gold
was
so
secret
the
boat
zipped
and
skipped
across
the
sea
the
sea
that
lay
between
the
main
islands
of
the
only
archipelago
of
any
useful
size
on
the
whole
planet
zaphod
beeblebrox
was
on
his
way
from
the
tiny
spaceport
on
easter
island
the
name
was
an
entirely
meaningless
coincidence
in
galacticspeke
easter
means
small
flat
and
light
brown
to
the
heart
of
gold
island
which
by
another
meaningless
coincidence
was
called
france
one
of
the
side
effects
of
work
on
the
heart
of
gold
was
a
whole
string
of
pretty
meaningless
coincidences
but
it
was
not
in
any
way
a
coincidence
that
today
the
day
of
culmination
of
the
project
the
great
day
of
unveiling
the
day
that
the
heart
of
gold
was
finally
to
be
introduced
to
a
marvelling
galaxy
was
also
a
great
day
of
culmination
for
zaphod
beeblebrox
it
was
for
the
sake
of
this
day
that
he
had
first
decided
to
run
for
the
presidency
a
decision
which
had
sent
waves
of
astonishment
throughout
the
imperial
galaxy
zaphod
beeblebrox
president
not
the
zaphod
beeblebrox
not
the
president
many
had
seen
it
as
a
clinching
proof
that
the
whole
of
known
creation
had
finally
gone
bananas
zaphod
grinned
and
gave
the
boat
an
extra
kick
of
speed
zaphod
beeblebrox
adventurer
exhippy
good
timer
crook
quite
possibly
manic
selfpublicist
terribly
bad
at
personal
relationships
often
thought
to
be
completely
out
to
lunch
president
no
one
had
gone
bananas
not
in
that
way
at
least
only
six
people
in
the
entire
galaxy
understood
the
principle
on
which
the
galaxy
was
governed
and
they
knew
that
once
zaphod
beeblebrox
had
announced
his
intention
to
run
as
president
it
was
more
or
less
a
fait
accompli
he
was
the
ideal
presidency
fodder
what
they
completely
failed
to
understand
was
why
zaphod
was
doing
it
he
banked
sharply
shooting
a
wild
wall
of
water
at
the
sun
today
was
the
day
today
was
the
day
when
they
would
realize
what
zaphod
had
been
up
to
today
was
what
zaphod
beeblebrox's
presidency
was
all
about
today
was
also
his
two
hundredth
birthday
but
that
was
just
another
meaningless
coincidence
as
he
skipped
his
boat
across
the
seas
of
damogran
he
smiled
quietly
to
himself
about
what
a
wonderful
exciting
day
it
was
going
to
be
he
relaxed
and
spread
his
two
arms
lazily
across
the
seat
back
he
steered
with
an
extra
arm
he'd
recently
fitted
just
beneath
his
right
one
to
help
improve
his
skiboxing
hey
he
cooed
to
himself
you're
a
real
cool
boy
you
but
his
nerves
sang
a
song
shriller
than
a
dog
whistle
the
island
of
france
was
about
twenty
miles
long
five
miles
across
the
middle
sandy
and
crescent
shaped
in
fact
it
seemed
to
exist
not
so
much
as
an
island
in
its
own
right
as
simply
a
means
of
defining
the
sweep
and
curve
of
a
huge
bay
this
impression
was
heightened
by
the
fact
that
the
inner
coastline
of
the
crescent
consisted
almost
entirely
of
steep
cliffs
from
the
top
of
the
cliff
the
land
sloped
slowly
down
five
miles
to
the
opposite
shore
on
top
of
the
cliffs
stood
a
reception
committee
it
consisted
in
large
part
of
the
engineers
and
researchers
who
had
built
the
heart
of
gold
mostly
humanoid
but
here
and
there
were
a
few
reptiloid
atomineers
two
or
three
green
slyphlike
maximegalacticans
an
octopoid
physucturalist
or
two
and
a
hooloovoo
a
hooloovoo
is
a
superintelligent
shade
of
the
color
blue
all
except
the
hooloovoo
were
resplendent
in
their
multi
colored
ceremonial
lab
coats
the
hooloovoo
had
been
temporarily
refracted
into
a
free
standing
prism
for
the
occasion
there
was
a
mood
of
immense
excitement
thrilling
through
all
of
them
together
and
between
them
they
had
gone
to
and
beyond
the
furthest
limits
of
physical
laws
restructured
the
fundamental
fabric
of
matter
strained
twisted
and
broken
the
laws
of
possibility
and
impossibility
but
still
the
greatest
excitement
of
all
seemed
to
be
to
meet
a
man
with
an
orange
sash
round
his
neck
an
orange
sash
was
what
the
president
of
the
galaxy
traditionally
wore
it
might
not
even
have
made
much
difference
to
them
if
they'd
known
exactly
how
much
power
the
president
of
the
galaxy
actually
wielded
none
at
all
only
six
people
in
the
galaxy
knew
that
the
job
of
the
galactic
president
was
not
to
wield
power
but
to
attract
attention
away
from
it
zaphod
beeblebrox
was
amazingly
good
at
his
job
the
crowd
gasped
dazzled
by
sun
and
seemanship
as
the
presidential
speedboat
zipped
round
the
headland
into
the
bay
it
flashed
and
shone
as
it
came
skating
over
the
sea
in
wide
skidding
turns
in
fact
it
didn't
need
to
touch
the
water
at
all
because
it
was
supported
on
a
hazy
cushion
of
ionized
atoms
but
just
for
effect
it
was
fitted
with
thin
finblades
which
could
be
lowered
into
the
water
they
slashed
sheets
of
water
hissing
into
the
air
carved
deep
gashes
into
the
sea
which
swayed
crazily
and
sank
back
foaming
into
the
boat's
wake
as
it
careered
across
the
bay
zaphod
loved
effect
it
was
what
he
was
best
at
he
twisted
the
wheel
sharply
the
boat
slewed
round
in
a
wild
scything
skid
beneath
the
cliff
face
and
dropped
to
rest
lightly
on
the
rocking
waves
within
seconds
he
ran
out
onto
the
deck
and
waved
and
grinned
at
over
three
billion
people
the
three
billion
people
weren't
actually
there
but
they
watched
his
every
gesture
through
the
eyes
of
a
small
robot
trid
camera
which
hovered
obsequiously
in
the
air
nearby
the
antics
of
the
president
always
made
amazingly
popular
trid
that's
what
they
were
for
he
grinned
again
three
billion
and
six
people
didn't
know
it
but
today
would
be
a
bigger
antic
than
anyone
had
bargained
for
the
robot
camera
homed
in
for
a
close
up
on
the
more
popular
of
his
two
heads
and
he
waved
again
he
was
roughly
humanoid
in
appearance
except
for
the
extra
head
and
third
arm
his
fair
tousled
hair
stuck
out
in
random
directions
his
blue
eyes
glinted
with
something
completely
unidentifiable
and
his
chins
were
almost
always
unshaven
a
twentyfoothigh
transparent
globe
floated
next
to
his
boat
rolling
and
bobbing
glistening
in
the
brilliant
sun
inside
it
floated
a
wide
semicircular
sofa
upholstered
in
glorious
red
leather
the

the
globe
bobbed
and
rolled
the
more
the
sofa
stayed
perfectly
still
steady
as
an
upholstered
rock

all
done
for
effect
as
much
as
anything
zaphod
stepped
through
the
wall
of
the
globe
and
relaxed
on
the
sofa
he
spread
his
two
arms
lazily
along
the
back
and
with
the
third
brushed
some
dust
off
his
knee
his
heads
looked
about
smiling
he
put
his
feet
up
at
any
moment
he
thought
he
might
scream

up
beneath

of

zaphod
smiled
picturing
himself
a
thoroughly
ridiculous
form
of
transport
but
a
thoroughly
beautiful
one
at
the
top
of
the
cliff
the
globe
wavered
for
a
moment
tipped
on
to
a
railed
ramp
rolled
down
it
to
a
small
concave
platform
and
riddled
to
a
halt
to
tremendous
applause
zaphod
beeblebrox
stepped
out
of
the
bubble
his
orange
sash
blazing
in
the
light
the
president
of
the
galaxy
had
arrived
he
waited
for
the
applause
to
die
down
then
raised
his
hands
in
greeting
hi
he
said
a
government
spider
sidled
up
to
him
and
attempted
to
press
a
copy
of
his
prepared
speech
into
his
hands
pages
three
to
seven
of
the
original
version
were
at
the
moment
floating
soggily
on
the
damogran
sea
some
five
miles
out
from
the
bay
pages
one
and
two
had
been
salvaged
by
a
damogran
frond
crested
eagle
and
had
already
become
incorporated
into
an
extraordinary
new
form
of
nest
which
the
eagle
had
invented
it
was
constructed
largely
of
papier
mch
and
it
was
virtually
impossible
for
a
newly
hatched
baby
eagle
to
break
out
of
it
the
damogran
frond
crested
eagle
had
heard
of
the
notion
of
survival
of
the
species
but
wanted
no
truck
with
it
zaphod
beeblebrox
would
not
be
needing
his
set
speech
and
he
gently
deflected
the
one
being
offered
him
by
the
spider
hi
he
said
again
everyone
beamed
at
him
or
at
least
nearly
everyone
he
singled
out
trillian
from
the
crowd
trillian
was
a
gird
that
zaphod
had
picked
up
recently
whilst
visiting
a
planet
just
for
fun
incognito
she
was
slim
darkish
humanoid
with
long
waves
of
black
hair
a
full
mouth
an
odd
little
nob
of
a
nose
and
ridiculously
brown
eyes
with
her
red
head
scarf
knotted
in
that
particular
way
and
her
long
flowing
silky
brown
dress
she
looked
vaguely
arabic
not
that
anyone
there
had
ever
heard
of
an
arab
of
course
the
arabs
had
very
recently
ceased
to
exist
and
even
when
they
had
existed
they
were
five
hundred
thousand
light
years
from
damogran
trillian
wasn't
anybody
in
particular
or
so
zaphod
claimed
she
just
went
around
with
him
rather
a
lot
and
told
him
what
she
thought
of
him
hi
honey
he
said
to
her
she
flashed
him
a
quick
tight
smile
and
looked
away
then
she
looked
back
for
a
moment
and
smiled
more
warmly
but
by
this
time
he
was
looking
at
something
else
hi
he
said
to
a
small
knot
of
creatures
from
the
press
who
were
standing
nearby
wishing
that
he
would
stop
saying
hi
and
get
on
with
the
quotes
he
grinned
at
them
particularly
because
he
knew
that
in
a
few
moments
he
would
be
giving
them
one
hell
of
a
quote
the
next
thing
he
said
though
was
not
a
lot
of
use
to
them
one
of
the
officials
of
the
party
had
irritably
decided
that
the
president
was
clearly
not
in
a
mood
to
read
the
deliciously
turned
speech
that
had
been
written
for
him
and
had
flipped
the
switch
on
the
remote
control
device
in
his
pocket
away
in
front
of
them
a
huge
white
dome
that
bulged
against
the
sky
cracked
down
in
the
middle
split
and
slowly
folded
itself
down
into
the
ground
everyone
gasped
although
they
had
known
perfectly
well
it
was
going
to
do
that
because
they
had
built
it
that
way
beneath
it
lay
uncovered
a
huge
starship
one
hundred
and
fifty
metres
long
shaped
like
a
sleek
running
shoe
perfectly
white
and
mindboggingly
beautiful
at
the
heart
of
it
unseen
lay
a
small
gold
box
which
carried
within
it
the
most
brainwretching
device
ever
conceived
a
device
which
made
this
starship
unique
in
the
history
of
the
galaxy
a
device
after
which
the
ship
had
been
named
the
heart
of
gold
wow
said
zaphod
beeblebrox
to
the
heart
of
gold
there
wasn't
much
else
he
could
say
he
said
it
again
because
he
knew
it
would
annoy
the
press
wow
the
crowd
turned
their
faces
back
towards
him
expectantly
he
winked
at
trillian
who
raised
her
eyebrows
and
widened
her
eyes
at
him
she
knew
what
he
was
about
to
say
and
thought
him
a
terrible
showoff
that
is
really
amazing
he
said
that
really
is
truly
amazing
that
is
so
amazingly
amazing
i
think
i'd
like
to
steal
it
a
marvellous
presidential
quote
absolutely
true
to
form
the
crowd
laughed
appreciatively
the
newsmen
gleefully
punched
buttons
on
their
subetha
newsmatics
and
the
president
grinned
as
he
grinned
his
heart
screamed
unbearably
and
he
fingered
the
small
paralysomatic
bomb
that
nestled
quietly
in
his
pocket
finally
he
could
bear
it
no
more
he
lifted
his
heads
up
to
the
sky
let
out
a
wild
whoop
in
major
thirds
threw
the
bomb
to
the
ground
and
ran
forward
through
the
sea
of
suddenly
frozen
smiles
chapter
prostetnic
vogon
jeltz
was
not
a
pleasant
sight
even
for
other
vogons
his
highly
domed
nose
rose
high
above
a
small
piggy
forehead
his
dark
green
rubbery
skin
was
thick
enough
for
him
to
play
the
game
of
vogon
civil
service
politics
and
play
it
well
and
waterproof
enough
for
him
to
survive
indefinitely
at
sea
depths
of
up
to
a
thousand
feet
with
no
ill
effects
not
that
he
ever
went
swimming
of
course
his
busy
schedule
would
not
allow
it
he
was
the
way
he
was
because
billions
of
years
ago
when
the
vogons
had
first
crawled
out
of
the
sluggish
primeval
seas
of
vogsphere
and
had
lain
panting
and
heaving
on
the
planet's
virgin
shores
when
the
first
rays
of
the
bright
young
vogsol
sun
had
shone
across
them
that
morning
it
was
as
if
the
forces
of
evolution
ad
simply
given
up
on
them
there
and
then
had
turned
aside
in
disgust
and
written
them
off
as
an
ugly
and
unfortunate
mistake
they
never
evolved
again
they
should
never
have
survived
the
fact
that
they
did
is
some
kind
of
tribute
to
the
thick
willed
slugbrained
stubbornness
of
these
creatures
evolution
they
said
to
themselves
who
needs
it
and
what
nature
refused
to
do
for
them
they
simply
did
without
until
such
time
as
they
were
able
to
rectify
the
grosser
anatomical
inconveniences
with
surgery
meanwhile
the
natural
forces
on
the
planet
vogsphere
had
been
working
overtime
to
make
up
for
their
earlier
blunder
they
brought
forth
scintillating
jewelled
scuttling
crabs
which
the
vogons
ate
smashing
their
shells
with
iron
mallets
tall
aspiring
trees
with
breathtaking
slenderness
and
colour
which
the
vogons
cut
down
and
burned
the
crab
meat
with
elegant
gazelle
like
creatures
with
silken
coats
and
dewy
eyes
which
the
vogons
would
catch
and
sit
on
they
were
no
use
as
transport
because
their
backs
would
snap
instantly
but
the
vogons
sat
on
them
anyway
thus
the
planet
vogsphere
whiled
away
the
unhappy
millennia
until
the
vogons
suddenly
discovered
the
principles
of
interstellar
travel
within
a
few
short
vog
years
every
last
vogon
had
migrated
to
the
megabrantis
cluster
the
political
hub
of
the
galaxy
and
now
formed
the
immensely
powerful
backbone
of
the
galactic
civil
service
they
have
attempted
to
acquire
learning
they
have
attempted
to
acquire
style
and
social
grace
but
in
most
respects
the
modern
vogon
is
little
different
from
his
primitive
forebears
every
year
they
import
twentyseven
thousand
scintillating
jewelled
scuttling
crabs
from
their
native
planet
and
while
away
a
happy
drunken
night
smashing
them
to
bits
with
iron
mallets
prostetnic
vogon
jeltz
was
a
fairly
typical
vogon
in
that
he
was
thoroughly
vile
also
he
did
not
like
hitch
hikers
somewhere
in
a
small
dark
cabin
buried
deep
in
the
intestines
of
prostetnic
vogon
jeltz's
flagship
a
small
match
flared
nervously
the
owner
of
the
match
was
not
a
vogon
but
he
knew
all
about
them
and
was
right
to
be
nervous
his
name
was
ford
prefect
he
looked
about
the
cabin
but
could
see
very
little
strange
monstrous
shadows
loomed
and
leaped
with
the
tiny
flickering
flame
but
all
was
quiet
he
breathed
a
silent
thank
you
to
the
dentrassis
the
dentrassis
are
an
unruly
tribe
of
gourmands
a
wild
but
pleasant
bunch
whom
the
vogons
had
recently
taken
to
employing
as
catering
staff
on
their
long
haul
fleets
on
the
strict
understanding
that
they
keep
themselves
very
much
to
themselves
this
suited
the
dentrassis
fine
because
they
loved
vogon
money
which
is
one
of
the
hardest
currencies
in
space
but
loathed
the
vogons
themselves
the
only
sort
of
vogon
a
dentrassi
liked
to
see
was
an
annoyed
vogon
it
was
because
of
this
tiny
piece
of
information
that
ford
prefect
was
not
now
a
whiff
of
hydrogen
ozone
and
carbon
monoxide
he
heard
a
slight
groan
by
the
light
of
the
match
he
saw
a
heavy
shape
moving
slightly
on
the
floor
quickly
he
shook
the
match
out
reached
in
his
pocket
found
what
he
was
looking
for
and
took
it
out
he
crouched
on
the
floor
the
shape
moved
again
ford
prefect
said
i
bought
some
peanuts
arthur
dent
moved
and
groaned
again
muttering
incoherently
here
have
some
urged
ford
shaking
the
packet
again
if
you've
never
been
through
a
matter
transference
beam
before
you've
probably
lost
some
salt
and
protein
the
beer
you
had
should
have
cushioned
your
system
a
bit
whhhrrrr
said
arthur
dent
he
opened
his
eyes
it's
dark
he
said
yes
said
ford
prefect
it's
dark
no
light
said
arthur
dent
dark
no
light
one
of
the
things
ford
prefect
had
always
found
hardest
to
understand
about
human
beings
was
their
habit
of
continually
stating
and
repeating
the
obvious
as
in
it's
a
nice
day
or
you're
very
tall
or
oh
dear
you
seem
to
have
fallen
down
a
thirtyfoot
well
are
you
alright
at
first
ford
had
formed
a
theory
to
account
for
this
strange
behaviour
if
human
beings
don't
keep
exercising
their
lips
he
thought
their
mouths
probably
seize
up
after
a
few
months
consideration
and
observation
he
abandoned
this
theory
in
favour
of
a
new
one
if
they
don't
keep
on
exercising
their
lips
he
thought
their
brains
start
working
after
a
while
he
abandoned
this
one
as
well
as
being
obstructively
cynical
and
decided
he
quite
liked
human
beings
after
all
but
he
always
remained
desperately
worried
about
the
terrible
number
of
things
they
didn't
know
about
yes
he
agreed
with
arthur
no
light
he
helped
arthur
to
some
peanuts
how
do
you
feel
he
asked
like
a
military
academy
said
arthur
bits
of
me
keep
on
passing
out
ford
stared
at
him
blankly
in
the
darkness
if
i
asked
you
where
the
hell
we
were
said
arthur
weakly
would
i
regret
it
ford
stood
up
we're
safe
he
said
oh
good
said
arthur
we're
in
a
small
galley
cabin
said
ford
in
one
of
the
spaceships
of
the
vogon
constructor
fleet
ah
said
arthur
this
is
obviously
some
strange
usage
of
the
word
safe
that
i
wasn't
previously
aware
of
ford
struck
another
match
to
help
him
search
for
a
light
switch
monstrous
shadows
leaped
and
loomed
again
arthur
struggled
to
his
feet
and
hugged
himself
apprehensively
hideous
alien
shapes
seemed
to
throng
about
him
the
air
was
thick
with
musty
smells
which
sidled
into
his
lungs
without
identifying
themselves
and
a
low
irritating
hum
kept
his
brain
from
focusing
how
did
we
get
here
he
asked
shivering
slightly
we
hitched
a
lift
said
ford
excuse
me
said
arthur
are
you
trying
to
tell
me
that
we
just
stuck
out
our
thumbs
and
some
green
bugeyed
monster
stuck
his
head
out
and
said
hi
fellas
hop
right
in
i
can
take
you
as
far
as
the
basingstoke
roundabout
well
said
ford
the
thumb's
an
electronic
subetha
signalling
device
the
roundabout's
at
barnard's
star
six
light
years
away
but
otherwise
that's
more
or
less
right
and
the
bugeyed
monster
is
green
yes
fine
said
arthur
when
can
i
get
home
you
can't
said
ford
prefect
and
found
the
light
switch
shade
your
eyes
he
said
and
turned
it
on
even
ford
was
surprised
good
grief
said
arthur
is
this
really
the
interior
of
a
flying
saucer
prostetnic
vogon
jeltz
heaved
his
unpleasant
green
body
round
the
control
bridge
he
always
felt
vaguely
irritable
after
demolishing
populated
planets
he
wished
that
someone
would
come
and
tell
him
that
it
was
all
wrong
so
that
he
could
shout
at
them
and
feel
better
he
flopped
as
heavily
as
he
could
on
to
his
control
seat
in
the
hope
that
it
would
break
and
give
him
something
to
be
genuinely
angry
about
but
it
only
gave
a
complaining
sort
of
creak
go
away
he
shouted
at
a
young
vogon
guard
who
entered
the
bridge
at
that
moment
the
guard
vanished
immediately
feeling
rather
relieved
he
was
glad
it
wouldn't
now
be
him
who
delivered
the
report
they'd
just
received
the
report
was
an
official
release
which
said
that
a
wonderful
new
form
of
spaceship
drive
was
at
this
moment
being
unveiled
at
a
government
research
base
on
damogran
which
would
henceforth
make
all
hyperspatial
express
routes
unnecessary
another
door
slid
open
but
this
time
the
vogon
captain
didn't
shout
because
it
was
the
door
from
the
galley
quarters
where
the
dentrassis
prepared
his
meals
a
meal
would
be
most
welcome
a
huge
furry
creature
bounded
through
the
door
with
his
lunch
tray
it
was
grinning
like
a
maniac
prostetnic
vogon
jeltz
was
delighted
he
knew
that
when
a
dentrassi
looked
that
pleased
with
itself
there
was
something
going
on
somewhere
on
the
ship
that
he
could
get
very
angry
indeed
about
ford
and
arthur
stared
about
them
well
what
do
you
think
said
ford
it's
a
bit
squalid
isn't
it
ford
frowned
at
the
grubby
mattress
unwashed
cups
and
unidentifiable
bits
of
smelly
alien
underwear
that
lay
around
the
cramped
cabin
well
this
is
a
working
ship
you
see
said
ford
these
are
the
dentrassi
sleeping
quarters
i
thought
you
said
they
were
called
vogons
or
something
yes
said
ford
the
vogons
run
the
ship
the
dentrassis
are
the
cooks
they
let
us
on
board
i'm
confused
said
arthur
here
have
a
look
at
this
said
ford
he
sat
down
on
one
of
the
mattresses
and
rummaged
about
in
his
satchel
arthur
prodded
the
mattress
nervously
and
then
sat
on
it
himself
in
fact
he
had
very
little
to
be
nervous
about
because
all
mattresses
grown
in
the
swamps
of
squornshellous
zeta
are
very
thoroughly
killed
and
dried
before
being
put
to
service
very
few
have
ever
come
to
life
again
ford
handed
the
book
to
arthur
what
is
it
asked
arthur
the
hitchhiker's
guide
to
the
galaxy
it's
a
sort
of
electronic
book
it
tells
you
everything
you
need
to
know
about
anything
that's
its
job
arthur
turned
it
over
nervously
in
his
hands
i
like
the
cover
he
said
don't
panic
it's
the
first
helpful
or
intelligible
thing
anybody's
said
to
me
all
day
i'll
show
you
how
it
works
said
ford
he
snatched
it
from
arthur
who
was
still
holding
it
as
if
it
was
a
twoweekdead
lark
and
pulled
it
out
of
its
cover
you
press
this
button
here
you
see
and
the
screen
lights
up
giving
you
the
index
a
screen
about
three
inches
by
four
lit
up
and
characters
began
to
flicker
across
the
surface
you
want
to
know
about
vogons
so
i
enter
that
name
so
his
fingers
tapped
some
more
keys
and
there
we
are
the
words
vogon
constructor
fleets
flared
in
green
across
the
screen
ford
pressed
a
large
red
button
at
the
bottom
of
the
screen
and
words
began
to
undulate
across
it
at
the
same
time
the
book
began
to
speak
the
entry
as
well
in
a
still
quiet
measured
voice
this
is
what
the
book
said
vogon
constructor
fleets
here
is
what
to
do
if
you
want
to
get
a
lift
from
a
vogon
forget
it
they
are
one
of
the
most
unpleasant
races
in
the
galaxy
not
actually
evil
but
bad
tempered
bureaucratic
officious
and
callous
they
wouldn't
even
lift
a
finger
to
save
their
own
grandmothers
from
the
ravenous
bugblatter
beast
of
traal
without
orders
signed
in
triplicate
sent
in
sent
back
queried
lost
found
subjected
to
public
inquiry
lost
again
and
finally
buried
in
soft
peat
and
recycled
as
firelighters
the
best
way
to
get
a
drink
out
of
a
vogon
is
to
stick
your
finger
down
his
throat
and
the
best
way
to
irritate
him
is
to
feed
his
grandmother
to
the
ravenous
bugblatter
beast
of
traal
on
no
account
allow
a
vogon
to
read
poetry
at
you
arthur
blinked
at
it
what
a
strange
book
how
did
we
get
a
lift
then
that's
the
point
it's
out
of
date
now
said
ford
sliding
the
book
back
into
its
cover
i'm
doing
the
field
research
for
the
new
revised
edition
and
one
of
the
things
i'll
have
to
include
is
a
bit
about
how
the
vogons
now
employ
dentrassi
cooks
which
gives
us
a
rather
useful
little
loophole
a
pained
expression
crossed
arthur's
face
but
who
are
the
dentrassi
he
said
great
guys
said
ford
they're
the
best
cooks
and
the
best
drink
mixers
and
they
don't
give
a
wet
slap
about
anything
else
and
they'll
always
help
hitch
hikers
aboard
partly
because
they
like
the
company
but
mostly
because
it
annoys
the
vogons
which
is
exactly
the
sort
of
thing
you
need
to
know
if
you're
an
impoverished
hitch
hiker
trying
to
see
the
marvels
of
the
universe
for
less
than
thirty
altairan
dollars
a
day
and
that's
my
job
fun
isn't
it
arthur
looked
lost
it's
amazing
he
said
and
frowned
at
one
of
the
other
mattresses
unfortunately
i
got
stuck
on
the
earth
for
rather
longer
than
i
intended
said
ford
i
came
for
a
week
and
got
stuck
for
fifteen
years
but
how
did
you
get
there
in
the
first
place
then
easy
i
got
a
lift
with
a
teaser
a
teaser
yeah
er
what
is
a
teaser
teasers
are
usually
rich
kids
with
nothing
to
do
they
cruise
around
looking
for
planets
which
haven't
made
interstellar
contact
yet
and
buzz
them
buzz
them
arthur
began
to
feel
that
ford
was
enjoying
making
life
difficult
for
him
yeah
said
ford
they
buzz
them
they
find
some
isolated
spot
with
very
few
people
around
then
land
right
by
some
poor
soul
whom
no
one's
ever
going
to
believe
and
then
strut
up
and
down
in
front
of
him
wearing
silly
antennae
on
their
heads
and
making
beep
beep
noises
rather
childish
really
ford
leant
back
on
the
mattress
with
his
hands
behind
his
head
and
looked
infuriatingly
pleased
with
himself
ford
insisted
arthur
i
don't
know
if
this
sounds
like
a
silly
question
but
what
am
i
doing
here
well
you
know
that
said
ford
i
rescued
you
from
the
earth
and
what's
happened
to
the
earth
ah
it's
been
demolished
has
it
said
arthur
levelly
yes
it
just
boiled
away
into
space
look
said
arthur
i'm
a
bit
upset
about
that
ford
frowned
to
himself
and
seemed
to
roll
the
thought
around
his
mind
yes
i
can
understand
that
he
said
at
last
understand
that
shouted
arthur
understand
that
ford
sprang
up
keep
looking
at
the
book
he
hissed
urgently
what
don't
panic
i'm
not
panicking
yes
you
are
alright
so
i'm
panicking
what
else
is
there
to
do
you
just
come
along
with
me
and
have
a
good
time
the
galaxy's
a
fun
place
you'll
need
to
have
this
fish
in
your
ear
i
beg
your
pardon
asked
arthur
rather
politely
he
thought
ford
was
holding
up
a
small
glass
jar
which
quite
clearly
had
a
small
yellow
fish
wriggling
around
in
it
arthur
blinked
at
him
he
wished
there
was
something
simple
and
recognizable
he
could
grasp
hold
of
he
would
have
felt
safe
if
alongside
the
dentrassi
underwear
the
piles
of
squornshellous
mattresses
and
the
man
from
betelgeuse
holding
up
a
small
yellow
fish
and
offering
to
put
it
in
his
ear
he
had
been
able
to
see
just
a
small
packet
of
corn
flakes
he
couldn't
and
he
didn't
feel
safe
suddenly
a
violent
noise
leapt
at
them
from
no
source
that
he
could
identify
he
gasped
in
terror
at
what
sounded
like
a
man
trying
to
gargle
whilst
fighting
off
a
pack
of
wolves
shush
said
ford
listen
it
might
be
important
im
important
it's
the
vogon
captain
making
an
announcement
on
the
t'annoy
you
mean
that's
how
the
vogons
talk
listen
but
i
can't
speak
vogon
you
don't
need
to
just
put
that
fish
in
your
ear
ford
with
a
lightning
movement
clapped
his
hand
to
arthur's
ear
and
he
had
the
sudden
sickening
sensation
of
the
fish
slithering
deep
into
his
aural
tract
gasping
with
horror
he
scrabbled
at
his
ear
for
a
second
or
so
but
then
slowly
turned
goggleeyed
with
wonder
he
was
experiencing
the
aural
equivalent
of
looking
at
a
picture
of
two
black
silhouetted
faces
and
suddenly
seeing
it
as
a
picture
of
a
white
candlestick
or
of
looking
at
a
lot
of
coloured
dots
on
a
piece
of
paper
which
suddenly
resolve
themselves
into
the
figure
six
and
mean
that
your
optician
is
going
to
charge
you
a
lot
of
money
for
a
new
pair
of
glasses
he
was
still
listening
to
the
howling
gargles
he
knew
that
only
now
it
had
taken
on
the
semblance
of
perfectly
straightforward
english
this
is
what
he
heard

stop
whatever
you're
doing
and
pay
attention
first
of
all
i
see
from
our
instruments
that
we
have
a
couple
of
hitchhikers
aboard
hello
wherever
you
are
i
just
want
to
make
it
totally
clear
that
you
are
not
at
all
welcome
i
worked
hard
to
get
where
i
am
today
and
i
didn't
become
captain
of
a
vogon
constructor
ship
simply
so
i
could
turn
it
into
a
taxi
service
for
a
load
of
degenerate
freeloaders
i
have
sent
out
a
search
party
and
as
soon
that
they
find
you
i
will
put
you
off
the
ship
if
you're
very
lucky
i
might
read
you
some
of
my
poetry
first
secondly
we
are
about
to
jump
into
hyperspace
for
the
journey
to
barnard's
star
on
arrival
we
will
stay
in
dock
for
a
seventytwo
hour
refit
and
no
one's
to
leave
the
ship
during
that
time
i
repeat
all
planet
leave
is
cancelled
i've
just
had
an
unhappy
love
affair
so
i
don't
see
why
anybody
else
should
have
a
good
time
message
ends
the
noise
stopped
arthur
discovered
to
his
embarrassment
that
he
was
lying
curled
up
in
a
small
ball
on
the
floor
with
his
arms
wrapped
round
his
head
he
smiled
weakly
charming
man
he
said
i
wish
i
had
a
daughter
so
i
could
forbid
her
to
marry
one
you
wouldn't
need
to
said
ford
they've
got
as
much
sex
appeal
as
a
road
accident
no
don't
move
he
added
as
arthur
began
to
uncurl
himself
you'd
better
be
prepared
for
the
jump
into
hyperspace
it's
unpleasantly
like
being
drunk
what's
so
unpleasant
about
being
drunk
you
ask
a
glass
of
water
arthur
thought
about
this
ford
he
said
yeah
what's
this
fish
doing
in
my
ear
it's
translating
for
you
it's
a
babel
fish
look
it
up
in
the
book
if
you
like
he
tossed
over
the
hitch
hiker's
guide
to
the
galaxy
and
then
curled
himself
up
into
a
foetal
ball
to
prepare
himself
for
the
jump
at
that
moment
the
bottom
fell
out
of
arthur's
mind
his
eyes
turned
inside
out
his
feet
began
to
leak
out
of
the
top
of
his
head
the
room
folded
flat
about
him
spun
around
shifted
out
of
existence
and
left
him
sliding
into
his
own
navel
they
were
passing
through
hyperspace
the
babel
fish
said
the
hitch
hiker's
guide
to
the
galaxy
quietly
is
small
yellow
and
leechlike
and
probably
the
oddest
thing
in
the
universe
it
feeds
on
brainwave
energy
not
from
its
carrier
but
from
those
around
it
it
absorbs
all
unconscious
mental
frequencies
from
this
brainwave
energy
to
nourish
itself
with
it
then
excretes
into
the
mind
of
its
carrier
a
telepathic
matrix
formed
by
combining
the
conscious
thought
frequencies
with
nerve
signals
picked
up
from
the
speech
centres
of
the
brain
which
has
supplied
them
the
practical
upshot
of
all
this
is
that
if
you
stick
a
babel
fish
in
your
ear
you
can
instantly
understand
anything
said
to
you
in
any
form
of
language
the
speech
patterns
you
actually
hear
decode
the
brainwave
matrix
which
has
been
fed
into
your
mind
by
your
babel
fish
now
it
is
such
a
bizarrely
improbable
coincidence
that
anything
so
mindboggingly
useful
could
have
evolved
purely
by
chance
that
some
thinkers
have
chosen
to
see
it
as
the
final
and
clinching
proof
of
the
nonexistence
of
god
the
argument
goes
something
like
this
i
refuse
to
prove
that
i
exist
says
god
for
proof
denies
faith
and
without
faith
i
am
nothing
but
says
man
the
babel
fish
is
a
dead
giveaway
isn't
it
it
could
not
have
evolved
by
chance
it
proves
you
exist
and
so
therefore
by
your
own
arguments
you
don't
qed
oh
dear
says
god
i
hadn't
thought
of
that
and
promptly
vanished
in
a
puff
of
logic
oh
that
was
easy
says
man
and
for
an
encore
goes
on
to
prove
that
black
is
white
and
gets
himself
killed
on
the
next
zebra
crossing
most
leading
theologians
claim
that
this
argument
is
a
load
of
dingo's
kidneys
but
that
didn't
stop
oolon
colluphid
making
a
small
fortune
when
he
used
it
as
the
central
theme
of
his
best
selling
book
well
that
about
wraps
it
up
for
god
meanwhile
the
poor
babel
fish
by
effectively
removing
all
barriers
to
communication
between
different
races
and
cultures
has
caused
more
and
bloddier
wars
than
anything
else
in
the
history
of
creation
arthur
let
out
a
low
groan
he
was
horrified
to
discover
that
the
kick
through
hyperspace
hadn't
killed
him
he
was
now
six
light
years
from
the
place
that
the
earth
would
have
been
if
it
still
existed
the
earth
visions
of
it
swam
sickeningly
through
his
nauseated
mind
there
was
no
way
his
imagination
could
feel
the
impact
of
the
whole
earth
having
gone
it
was
too
big
he
prodded
his
feelings
by
thinking
that
his
parents
and
his
sister
had
gone
no
reaction
he
thought
of
all
the
people
he
had
been
close
to
no
reaction
then
he
thought
of
a
complete
stranger
he
had
been
standing
behind
in
the
queue
at
the
supermarket
before
and
felt
a
sudden
stab
the
supermarket
was
gone
everything
in
it
was
gone
nelson's
column
had
gone
nelson's
column
had
gone
and
there
would
be
no
outcry
because
there
was
no
one
left
to
make
an
outcry
from
now
on
nelson's
column
only
existed
in
his
mind
england
only
existed
in
his
mind
his
mind
stuck
here
in
this
dank
smelly
steellined
spaceship
a
wave
of
claustrophobia
closed
in
on
him
england
no
longer
existed
he'd
got
that
somehow
he'd
got
it
he
tried
again
america
he
thought
has
gone
he
couldn't
grasp
it
he
decided
to
start
smaller
again
new
york
has
gone
no
reaction
he'd
never
seriously
believed
it
existed
anyway
the
dollar
he
thought
had
sunk
for
ever
slight
tremor
there
every
bogart
movie
has
been
wiped
he
said
to
himself
and
that
gave
him
a
nasty
knock
mcdonalds
he
thought
there
is
no
longer
any
such
thing
as
a
mcdonald's
hamburger
he
passed
out
when
he
came
round
a
second
later
he
found
he
was
sobbing
for
his
mother
he
jerked
himself
violently
to
his
feet
ford
ford
looked
up
from
where
he
was
sitting
in
a
corner
humming
to
himself
he
always
found
the
actual
travellingthroughspace
part
of
space
travel
rather
trying
yeah
he
said
if
you're
a
researcher
on
this
book
thing
and
you
were
on
earth
you
must
have
been
gathering
material
on
it
well
i
was
able
to
extend
the
original
entry
a
bit
yes
let
me
see
what
it
says
in
this
edition
then
i've
got
to
see
it
yeah
ok
he
passed
it
over
again
arthur
grabbed
hold
of
it
and
tried
to
stop
his
hands
shaking
he
pressed
the
entry
for
the
relevant
page
the
screen
flashed
and
swirled
and
resolved
into
a
page
of
print
arthur
stared
at
it
it
doesn't
have
an
entry
he
burst
out
ford
looked
over
his
shoulder
yes
it
does
he
said
down
there
see
at
the
bottom
of
the
screen
just
under
eccentrica
gallumbits
the
triplebreasted
whore
of
eroticon
arthur
followed
ford's
finger
and
saw
where
it
was
pointing
for
a
moment
it
still
didn't
register
then
his
mind
nearly
blew
up
what
harmless
is
that
all
it's
got
to
say
harmless
one
word
ford
shrugged
well
there
are
a
hundred
billion
stars
in
the
galaxy
and
only
a
limited
amount
of
space
in
the
book's
microprocessors
he
said
and
no
one
knew
much
about
the
earth
of
course
well
for
god's
sake
i
hope
you
managed
to
rectify
that
a
bit
oh
yes
well
i
managed
to
transmit
a
new
entry
off
to
the
editor
he
had
to
trim
it
a
bit
but
it's
still
an
improvement
and
what
does
it
say
now
asked
arthur
mostly
harmless
admitted
ford
with
a
slightly
embarrassed
cough
mostly
harmless
shouted
arthur
what
was
that
noise
hissed
ford
it
was
me
shouting
shouted
arthur
no
shut
up
said
ford
i
think
we're
in
trouble
you
think
we're
in
trouble
outside
the
door
were
the
sounds
of
marching
feet
the
dentrassi
whispered
arthur
no
those
are
steel
tipped
boots
said
ford
there
was
a
sharp
ringing
rap
on
the
door
then
who
is
it
said
arthur
well
said
ford
if
we're
lucky
it's
just
the
vogons
come
to
throw
us
in
to
space
and
if
we're
unlucky
if
we're
unlucky
said
ford
grimly
the
captain
might
be
serious
in
his
threat
that
he's
going
to
read
us
some
of
his
poetry
first

chapter
vogon
poetry
is
of
course
the
third
worst
in
the
universe
the
second
worst
is
that
of
the
azagoths
of
kria
during
a
recitation
by
their
poet
master
grunthos
the
flatulent
of
his
poem
ode
to
a
small
lump
of
green
putty
i
found
in
my
armpit
one
midsummer
morning
four
of
his
audience
died
of
internal
haemorrhaging
and
the
president
of
the
midgalactic
arts
nobbling
council
survived
by
gnawing
one
of
his
own
legs
off
grunthos
is
reported
to
have
been
disappointed
by
the
poem's
reception
and
was
about
to
embark
on
a
reading
of
his
twelve
book
epic
entitled
my
favourite
bathtime
gurgles
when
his
own
major
intestine
in
a
desperate
attempt
to
save
life
and
civilization
leapt
straight
up
through
his
neck
and
throttled
his
brain
the
very
worst
poetry
of
all
perished
along
with
its
creator
paula
nancy
millstone
jennings
of
greenbridge
essex
england
in
the
destruction
of
the
planet
earth
prostetnic
vogon
jeltz
smiled
very
slowly
this
was
done
not
so
much
for
effect
as
because
he
was
trying
to
remember
the
sequence
of
muscle
movements
he
had
had
a
terribly
therapeutic
yell
at
his
prisoners
and
was
now
feeling
quite
relaxed
and
ready
for
a
little
callousness
the
prisoners
sat
in
poetry
appreciation
chairs
strapped
in
vogons
suffered
no
illusions
as
to
the
regard
their
works
were
generally
held
in
their
early
attempts
at
composition
had
been
part
of
bludgeoning
insistence
that
they
be
accepted
as
a
properly
evolved
and
cultured
race
but
now
the
only
thing
that
kept
them
going
was
sheer
bloodymindedness
the
sweat
stood
out
cold
on
ford
prefect's
brow
and
slid
round
the
electrodes
strapped
to
his
temples
these
were
attached
to
a
battery
of
electronic
equipment
imagery
intensifiers
rhythmic
modulators
alliterative
residulators
and
simile
dumpers
all
designed
to
heighten
the
experience
of
the
poem
and
make
sure
that
not
a
single
nuance
of
the
poet's
thought
was
lost
arthur
dent
sat
and
quivered
he
had
no
idea
what
he
was
in
for
but
he
knew
that
he
hadn't
liked
anything
that
had
happened
so
far
and
didn't
think
things
were
likely
to
change
the
vogon
began
to
read
a
fetid
little
passage
of
his
own
devising
oh
frettled
gruntbuggly
he
began
spasms
wracked
ford's
body
this
was
worse
than
ever
he'd
been
prepared
for
thy
micturations
are
to
me
as
plurdled
gabbleblotchits
on
a
lurgid
bee
aaaaaaarggggghhhhhh
went
ford
prefect
wrenching
his
head
back
as
lumps
of
pain
thumped
through
it
he
could
dimly
see
beside
him
arthur
lolling
and
rolling
in
his
seat
he
clenched
his
teeth
groop
i
implore
thee
continued
the
merciless
vogon
my
foonting
turlingdromes
his
voice
was
rising
to
a
horrible
pitch
of
impassioned
stridency
and
hooptiously
drangle
me
with
crinkly
bindlewurdles
or
i
will
rend
thee
in
the
gobberwarts
with
my
blurglecruncheon
see
if
i
don't
nnnnnnnnnnyyyyyyyuuuuuuurrrrrrrggggggghhhhh
cried
ford
prefect
and
threw
one
final
spasm
as
the
electronic
enhancement
of
the
last
line
caught
him
full
blast
across
the
temples
he
went
limp
arthur
lolled
now
earthlings
whirred
the
vogon
he
didn't
know
that
ford
prefect
was
in
fact
from
a
small
planet
in
the
vicinity
of
betelgeuse
and
wouldn't
have
cared
if
he
had
i
present
you
with
a
simple
choice
either
die
in
the
vacuum
of
space
or
he
paused
for
melodramatic
effect
tell
me
how
good
you
thought
my
poem
was
he
threw
himself
backwards
into
a
huge
leathery
batshaped
seat
and
watched
them
he
did
the
smile
again
ford
was
rasping
for
breath
he
rolled
his
dusty
tongue
round
his
parched
mouth
and
moaned
arthur
said
brightly
actually
i
quite
liked
it
ford
turned
and
gaped
here
was
an
approach
that
had
quite
simply
not
occurred
to
him
the
vogon
raised
a
surprised
eyebrow
that
effectively
obscured
his
nose
and
was
therefore
no
bad
thing
oh
good
he
whirred
in
considerable
astonishment
oh
yes
said
arthur
i
thought
that
some
of
the
metaphysical
imagery
was
really
particularly
effective
ford
continued
to
stare
at
him
slowly
organizing
his
thoughts
around
this
totally
new
concept
were
they
really
going
to
be
able
to
bareface
their
way
out
of
this
yes
do
continue
invited
the
vogon
oh
and
er
interesting
rhythmic
devices
too
continued
arthur
which
seemed
to
counterpoint
the
er
er
he
floundered
ford
leaped
to
his
rescue
hazarding
counterpoint
the
surrealism
of
the
underlying
metaphor
of
the
er
he
floundered
too
but
arthur
was
ready
again
humanity
of
the
vogonity
ford
hissed
at
him
ah
yes
vogonity
sorry
of
the
poet's
compassionate
soul
arthur
felt
he
was
on
a
home
stretch
now
which
contrives
through
the
medium
of
the
verse
structure
to
sublimate
this
transcend
that
and
come
to
terms
with
the
fundamental
dichotomies
of
the
other
he
was
reaching
a
triumphant
crescendo
and
one
is
left
with
a
profound
and
vivid
insight
into
into
er

which
suddenly
gave
out
on
him
ford
leaped
in
with
the
coup
de
grce
into
whatever
it
was
the
poem
was
about
he
yelled
out
of
the
corner
of
his
mouth
well
done
arthur
that
was
very
good
the
vogon
perused
them
for
a
moment
his
embittered
racial
soul
had
been
touched
but
he
thought
no
too
little
too
late
his
voice
took
on
the
quality
of
a
cat
snagging
brushed
nylon
so
what
you're
saying
is
that
i
write
poetry
because
underneath
my
mean
callous
heartless
exterior
i
really
just
want
to
be
loved
he
said
he
paused
is
that
right
ford
laughed
a
nervous
laugh
well
i
mean
yes
he
said
don't
we
all
deep
down
you
know
er
the
vogon
stood
up
no
well
you're
completely
wrong
he
said
i
just
write
poetry
to
throw
my
mean
callous
heartless
exterior
into
sharp
relief
i'm
going
to
throw
you
off
the
ship
anyway
guard
take
the
prisoners
to
number
three
airlock
and
throw
them
out
what
shouted
ford
a
huge
young
vogon
guard
stepped
forward
and
yanked
them
out
of
their
straps
with
his
huge
blubbery
arms
you
can't
throw
us
into
space
yelled
ford
we're
trying
to
write
a
book
resistance
is
useless
shouted
the
vogon
guard
back
at
him
it
was
the
first
phrase
he'd
learnt
when
he
joined
the
vogon
guard
corps
the
captain
watched
with
detached
amusement
and
then
turned
away
arthur
stared
round
him
wildly
i
don't
want
to
die
now
he
yelled
i've
still
got
a
headache
i
don't
want
to
go
to
heaven
with
a
headache
i'd
be
all
cross
and
wouldn't
enjoy
it
the
guard
grasped
them
both
firmly
round
the
neck
and
bowing
deferentially
towards
his
captain's
back
hoiked
them
both
protesting
out
of
the
bridge
a
steel
door
closed
and
the
captain
was
on
his
own
again
he
hummed
quietly
and
mused
to
himself
lightly
fingering
his
notebook
of
verses
hmmmm
he
said
counterpoint
the
surrealism
of
the
underlying
metaphor
he
considered
this
for
a
moment
and
then
closed
the
book
with
a
grim
smile
death's
too
good
for
them
he
said
the
long
steellined
corridor
echoed
to
the
feeble
struggles
of
the
two
humanoids
clamped
firmly
under
rubbery
vogon
armpits
this
is
great
spluttered
arthur
this
is
really
terrific
let
go
of
me
you
brute
the
vogon
guard
dragged
them
on
don't
you
worry
said
ford
i'll
think
of
something
he
didn't
sound
hopeful
resistance
is
useless
bellowed
the
guard
just
don't
say
things
like
that
stammered
ford
how
can
anyone
maintain
a
positive
mental
attitude
if
you're
saying
things
like
that
my
god
complained
arthur
you're
talking
about
a
positive
mental
attitude
and
you
haven't
even
had
your
planet
demolished
today
i
woke
up
this
morning
and
thought
i'd
have
a
nice
relaxed
day
do
a
bit
of
reading
brush
the
dog
it's
now
just
after
four
in
the
afternoon
and
i'm
already
thrown
out
of
an
alien
spaceship
six
light
years
from
the
smoking
remains
of
the
earth
he
spluttered
and
gurgled
as
the
vogon
tightened
his
grip
alright
said
ford
just
stop
panicking
who
said
anything
about
panicking
snapped
arthur
this
is
still
just
the
culture
shock
you
wait
till
i've
settled
down
into
the
situation
and
found
my
bearings
then
i'll
start
panicking
arthur
you're
getting
hysterical
shut
up
ford
tried
desperately
to
think
but
was
interrupted
by
the
guard
shouting
again
resistance
is
useless
and
you
can
shut
up
as
well
snapped
ford
resistance
is
useless
oh
give
it
a
rest
said
ford
he
twisted
his
head
till
he
was
looking
straight
up
into
his
captor's
face
a
thought
struck
him
do
you
really
enjoy
this
sort
of
thing
he
asked
suddenly
the
vogon
stopped
dead
and
a
look
of
immense
stupidity
seeped
slowly
over
his
face
enjoy
he
boomed
what
do
you
mean
what
i
mean
said
ford
is
does
it
give
you
a
full
satisfying
life
stomping
around
shouting
pushing
people
out
of
spaceships
the
vogon
stared
up
at
the
low
steel
ceiling
and
his
eyebrows
almost
rolled
over
each
other
his
mouth
slacked
finally
he
said
well
the
hours
are
good
they'd
have
to
be
agreed
ford
arthur
twisted
his
head
to
look
at
ford
ford
what
are
you
doing
he
asked
in
an
amazed
whisper
oh
just
trying
to
take
an
interest
in
the
world
around
me
ok
he
said
so
the
hours
are
pretty
good
then
he
resumed
the
vogon
stared
down
at
him
as
sluggish
thoughts
moiled
around
in
the
murky
depths
yeah
he
said
but
now
you
come
to
mention
it
most
of
the
actual
minutes
are
pretty
lousy
except
he
thought
again
which
required
looking
at
the
ceiling
except
some
of
the
shouting
i
quite
like
he
filled
his
lungs
and
bellowed
resistance
is
sure
yes
interrupted
ford
hurriedly
you're
good
at
that
i
can
tell
but
if
it's
mostly
lousy
he
said
slowly
giving
the
words
time
to
reach
their
mark
then
why
do
you
do
it
what
is
it
the
girls
the
leather
the
machismo
or
do
you
just
find
that
coming
to
terms
with
the
mindless
tedium
of
it
all
presents
an
interesting
challenge
er
said
the
guard
er
er
i
dunno
i
think
i
just
sort
of
do
it
really
my
aunt
said
that
spaceship
guard
was
a
good
career
for
a
young
vogon
you
know
the
uniform
the
low
slung
stun
ray
holster
the
mindless
tedium
there
you
are
arthur
said
ford
with
the
air
of
someone
reaching
the
conclusion
of
his
argument
you
think
you've
got
problems
arthur
rather
thought
he
had
apart
from
the
unpleasant
business
with
his
home
planet
the
vogon
guard
had
halfthrottled
him
already
and
he
didn't
like
the
sound
of
being
thrown
into
space
very
much
try
and
understand
his
problem
insisted
ford
here
he
is
poor
lad
his
entire
life's
work
is
stamping
around
throwing
people
off
spaceships
and
shouting
added
the
guard
and
shouting
sure
said
ford
patting
the
blubbery
arm
clamped
round
his
neck
in
friendly
condescension
and
he
doesn't
even
know
why
he's
doing
it
arthur
agreed
this
was
very
sad
he
did
this
with
a
small
feeble
gesture
because
he
was
too
asphyxicated
to
speak
deep
rumblings
of
bemusement
came
from
the
guard
well
now
you
put
it
like
that
i
suppose
good
lad
encouraged
ford
but
alright
went
on
the
rumblings
so
what's
the
alternative
well
said
ford
brightly
but
slowly
stop
doing
it
of
course
tell
them
he
went
on
you're
not
going
to
do
it
anymore
he
felt
he
had
to
add
something
to
that
but
for
the
moment
the
guard
seemed
to
have
his
mind
occupied
pondering
that
much
eerrrrrrmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
said
the
guard
erm
well
that
doesn't
sound
that
great
to
me
ford
suddenly
felt
the
moment
slipping
away
now
wait
a
minute
he
said
that's
just
the
start
you
see
there's
more
to
it
than
that
you
see
but
at
that
moment
the
guard
renewed
his
grip
and
continued
his
original
purpose
of
lugging
his
prisoners
to
the
airlock
he
was
obviously
quite
touched
no
i
think
if
it's
all
the
same
to
you
he
said
i'd
better
get
you
both
shoved
into
this
airlock
and
then
go
and
get
on
with
some
other
bits
of
shouting
i've
got
to
do
it
wasn't
all
the
same
to
ford
prefect
after
all
come
on
now
but
look
he
said
less
slowly
less
brightly
huhhhhgggggggnnnnnnn
said
arthur
without
any
clear
inflection
but
hang
on
pursued
ford
there's
music
and
art
and
things
to
tell
you
about
yet
arrrggghhh
resistance
is
useless
bellowed
the
guard
and
then
added
you
see
if
i
keep
it
up
i
can
eventually
get
promoted
to
senior
shouting
officer
and
there
aren't
usually
many
vacancies
for
nonshouting
and
nonpushingpeopleabout
officers
so
i
think
i'd
better
stick
to
what
i
know
they
had
now
reached
the
airlock
a
large
circular
steel
hatchway
of
massive
strength
and
weight
let
into
the
inner
skin
of
the
craft
the
guard
operated
a
control
and
the
hatchway
swung
smoothly
open
but
thanks
for
taking
an
interest
said
the
vogon
guard
bye
now
he
flung
ford
and
arthur
through
the
hatchway
into
the
small
chamber
within
arthur
lay
panting
for
breath
ford
scrambled
round
and
flung
his
shoulder
uselessly
against
the
reclosing
hatchway
but
listen
he
shouted
to
the
guard
there's
a
whole
world
you
don't
know
anything
about
here
how
about
this
desperately
he
grabbed
for
the
only
bit
of
culture
he
knew
offhand
he
hummed
the
first
bar
of
beethoven's
fifth
da
da
da
dum
doesn't
that
stir
anything
in
you
no
said
the
guard
not
really
but
i'll
mention
it
to
my
aunt
if
he
said
anything
further
after
that
it
was
lost
the
hatchway
sealed
itself
tight
and
all
sound
was
lost
but
the
faint
distant
hum
of
the
ship's
engines
they
were
in
a
brightly
polished
cylindrical
chamber
about
six
feet
in
diameter
and
ten
feet
long
potentially
bright
lad
i
thought
he
said
and
slumped
against
the
curved
wall
arthur
was
still
lying
in
the
curve
of
the
floor
where
he
had
fallen
he
didn't
look
up
he
just
lay
panting
we're
trapped
now
aren't
we
yes
said
ford
we're
trapped
well
didn't
you
think
of
anything
i
thought
you
said
you
were
going
to
think
of
something
perhaps
you
thought
of
something
and
didn't
notice
oh
yes
i
thought
of
something
panted
ford
arthur
looked
up
expectantly
but
unfortunately
continued
ford
it
rather
involved
being
on
the
other
side
of
this
airtight
hatchway
he
kicked
the
hatch
they'd
just
been
through
but
it
was
a
good
idea
was
it
oh
yes
very
neat
what
was
it
well
i
hadn't
worked
out
the
details
yet
not
much
point
now
is
there
so
er
what
happens
next
oh
er
well
the
hatchway
in
front
of
us
will
open
automatically
in
a
few
moments
and
we
will
shoot
out
into
deep
space
i
expect
and
asphyxicate
if
you
take
a
lungful
of
air
with
you
you
can
last
for
up
to
thirty
seconds
of
course
said
ford
he
stuck
his
hands
behind
his
back
raised
his
eyebrows
and
started
to
hum
an
old
betelgeusian
battle
hymn
to
arthur's
eyes
he
suddenly
looked
very
alien
so
this
is
it
said
arthur
we're
going
to
die
yes
said
ford
except
no
wait
a
minute
he
suddenly
lunged
across
the
chamber
at
something
behind
arthur's
line
of
vision
what's
this
switch
he
cried
what
where
cried
arthur
twisting
round
no
i
was
only
fooling
said
ford
we
are
going
to
die
after
all
he
slumped
against
the
wall
again
and
carried
on
the
tune
from
where
he
left
off
you
know
said
arthur
it's
at
times
like
this
when
i'm
trapped
in
a
vogon
airlock
with
a
man
from
betelgeuse
and
about
to
die
of
asphyxication
in
deep
space
that
i
really
wish
i'd
listened
to
what
my
mother
told
me
when
i
was
young
why
what
did
she
tell
you
i
don't
know
i
didn't
listen
oh
ford
carried
on
humming
this
is
terrific
arthur
thought
to
himself
nelson's
column
has
gone
mcdonald's
have
gone
all
that's
left
is
me
and
the
words
mostly
harmless
any
second
now
all
that
will
be
left
is
mostly
harmless
and
yesterday
the
planet
seemed
to
be
going
so
well
a
motor
whirred
a
slight
hiss
built
into
a
deafening
roar
of
rushing
air
as
the
outer
hatchway
opened
on
to
an
empty
blackness
studded
with
tiny
impossibly
bright
points
of
light
ford
and
arthur
popped
into
outer
space
like
corks
from
a
toy
gun
chapter
the
hitch
hiker's
guide
to
the
galaxy
is
a
wholly
remarkable
book
it
has
been
compiled
and
recompiled
many
times
over
many
years
and
under
many
different
editorships
it
contains
contributions
from
countless
numbers
of
travellers
and
researchers
the
introduction
begins
like
this
space
it
says
is
big
really
big
you
just
won't
believe
how
vastly
hugely
mindboggingly
big
it
is
i
mean
you
may
think
it's
a
long
way
down
the
road
to
the
chemist
but
that's
just
peanuts
to
space
listen
and
so
on
after
a
while
the
style
settles
down
a
bit
and
it
begins
to
tell
you
things
you
really
need
to
know
like
the
fact
that
the
fabulously
beautiful
planet
bethselamin
is
now
so
worried
about
the
cumulative
erosion
by
ten
billion
visiting
tourists
a
year
that
any
net
imbalance
between
the
amount
you
eat
and
the
amount
you
excrete
whilst
on
the
planet
is
surgically
removed
from
your
bodyweight
when
you
leave
so
every
time
you
go
to
the
lavatory
it
is
vitally
important
to
get
a
receipt
to
be
fair
though
when
confronted
by
the
sheer
enormity
of
distances
between
the
stars
better
minds
than
the
one
responsible
for
the
guide's
introduction
have
faltered
some
invite
you
to
consider
for
a
moment
a
peanut
in
reading
and
a
small
walnut
in
johannesburg
and
other
such
dizzying
concepts
the
simple
truth
is
that
interstellar
distances
will
not
fit
into
the
human
imagination
even
light
which
travels
so
fast
that
it
takes
most
races
thousands
of
years
to
realize
that
it
travels
at
all
takes
time
to
journey
between
the
stars
it
takes
eight
minutes
from
the
star
sol
to
the
place
where
the
earth
used
to
be
and
four
years
more
to
arrive
at
sol's
nearest
stellar
neighbour
alpha
proxima
for
light
to
reach
the
other
side
of
the
galaxy
for
it
to
reach
damogran
for
instance
takes
rather
longer
five
hundred
thousand
years
the
record
for
hitch
hiking
this
distance
is
just
under
five
years
but
you
don't
get
to
see
much
on
the
way
the
hitch
hiker's
guide
to
the
galaxy
says
that
if
you
hold
a
lungful
of
air
you
can
survive
in
the
total
vacuum
of
space
for
about
thirty
seconds
however
it
goes
on
to
say
that
what
with
space
being
the
mind
boggling
size
it
is
the
chances
of
getting
picked
up
by
another
ship
within
those
thirty
seconds
are
two
to
the
power
of
two
hundred
and
sixtyseven
thousand
seven
hundred
and
nine
to
one
against
by
a
totally
staggering
coincidence
that
is
also
the
telephone
number
of
an
islington
flat
where
arthur
once
went
to
a
very
good
party
and
met
a
very
nice
girl
whom
he
totally
failed
to
get
off
with
she
went
off
with
a
gatecrasher
though
the
planet
earth
the
islington
flat
and
the
telephone
have
all
now
been
demolished
it
is
comforting
to
reflect
that
they
are
all
in
some
small
way
commemorated
by
the
fact
that
twentynine
seconds
later
ford
and
arthur
were
rescued
chapter
a
computer
chatted
to
itself
in
alarm
as
it
noticed
an
airlock
open
and
close
itself
for
no
apparent
reason
this
was
because
reason
was
in
fact
out
to
lunch
a
hole
had
just
appeared
in
the
galaxy
it
was
exactly
a
nothingth
of
a
second
long
a
nothingth
of
an
inch
wide
and
quite
a
lot
of
million
light
years
from
end
to
end
as
it
closed
up
lots
of
paper
hats
and
party
balloons
fell
out
of
it
and
drifted
off
through
the
universe
a
team
of
seven
three
foothigh
market
analysts
fell
out
of
it
and
died
partly
of
asphyxication
partly
of
surprise
two
hundred
and
thirtynine
thousand
lightly
fried
eggs
fell
out
of
it
too
materializing
in
a
large
woobly
heap
on
the
famine
struck
land
of
poghril
in
the
pansel
system
the
whole
poghril
tribe
had
died
out
from
famine
except
for
one
last
man
who
died
of
cholesterol
poisoning
some
weeks
later
the
nothingth
of
a
second
for
which
the
hole
existed
reverberated
backwards
and
forwards
through
time
in
a
most
improbable
fashion
somewhere
in
the
deeply
remote
past
it
seriously
traumatized
a
small
random
group
of
atoms
drifting
through
the
empty
sterility
of
space
and
made
them
cling
together
in
the
most
extraordinarily
unlikely
patterns
these
patterns
quickly
learnt
to
copy
themselves
this
was
part
of
what
was
so
extraordinary
of
the
patterns
and
went
on
to
cause
massive
trouble
on
every
planet
they
drifted
on
to
that
was
how
life
began
in
the
universe
five
wild
event
maelstroms
swirled
in
vicious
storms
of
unreason
and
spewed
up
a
pavement
on
the
pavement
lay
ford
prefect
and
arthur
dent
gulping
like
halfspent
fish
there
you
are
gasped
ford
scrabbling
for
a
fingerhold
on
the
pavement
as
it
raced
through
the
third
reach
of
the
unknown
i
told
you
i'd
think
of
something
oh
sure
said
arthur
sure
bright
idea
of
mine
said
ford
to
find
a
passing
spaceship
and
get
rescued
by
it
the
real
universe
arched
sickeningly
away
beneath
them
various
pretend
ones
flitted
silently
by
like
mountain
goats
primal
light
exploded
splattering
spacetime
as
with
gobbets
of
junket
time
blossomed
matter
shrank
away
the
highest
prime
number
coalesced
quietly
in
a
corner
and
hid
itself
away
for
ever
oh
come
off
it
said
arthur
the
chances
against
it
were
astronomical
don't
knock
it
it
worked
said
ford
what
sort
of
ship
are
we
in
asked
arthur
as
the
pit
of
eternity
yawned
beneath
them
i
don't
know
said
ford
i
haven't
opened
my
eyes
yet
no
nor
have
i
said
arthur
the
universe
jumped
froze
quivered
and
splayed
out
in
several
unexpected
directions
arthur
and
ford
opened
their
eyes
and
looked
about
in
considerable
surprise
good
god
said
arthur
it
looks
just
like
the
sea
front
at
southend
hell
i'm
relieved
to
hear
you
say
that
said
ford
why
because
i
thought
i
must
be
going
mad
perhaps
you
are
perhaps
you
only
thought
i
said
it
ford
thought
about
this
well
did
you
say
it
or
didn't
you
he
asked
i
think
so
said
arthur
well
perhaps
we're
both
going
mad
yes
said
arthur
we'd
be
mad
all
things
considered
to
think
this
was
southend
well
do
you
think
this
is
southend
oh
yes
so
do
i
therefore
we
must
be
mad
nice
day
for
it
yes
said
a
passing
maniac
who
was
that
asked
arthur
who
the
man
with
the
five
heads
and
the
elderberry
bush
full
of
kippers
yes
i
don't
know
just
someone
ah
they
both
sat
on
the
pavement
and
watched
with
a
certain
unease
as
huge
children
bounced
heavily
along
the
sand
and
wild
horses
thundered
through
the
sky
taking
fresh
supplies
of
reinforced
railings
to
the
uncertain
areas
you
know
said
arthur
with
a
slight
cough
if
this
is
southend
there's
something
very
odd
about
it
you
mean
the
way
the
sea
stays
steady
and
the
buildings
keep
washing
up
and
down
said
ford
yes
i
thought
that
was
odd
too
in
fact
he
continued
as
with
a
huge
bang
southend
split
itself
into
six
equal
segments
which
danced
and
span
giddily
round
each
other
in
lewd
and
licentious
formation
there
is
something
altogether
very
strange
going
on
wild
yowling
noises
of
pipes
and
strings
seared
through
the
wind
hot
doughnuts
popped
out
of
the
road
for
ten
pence
each
horrid
fish
stormed
out
of
the
sky
and
arthur
and
ford
decided
to
make
a
run
for
it
they
plunged
through
heavy
walls
of
sound
mountains
of
archaic
thought
valleys
of
mood
music
bad
shoe
sessions
and
footling
bats
and
suddenly
heard
a
girl's
voice
it
sounded
quite
a
sensible
voice
but
it
just
said
two
to
the
power
of
one
hundred
thousand
to
one
against
and
falling
and
that
was
all
ford
skidded
down
a
beam
of
light
and
span
round
trying
to
find
a
source
for
the
voice
but
could
see
nothing
he
could
seriously
believe
in
what
was
that
voice
shouted
arthur
i
don't
know
yelled
ford
i
don't
know
it
sounded
like
a
measurement
of
probability
probability
what
do
you
mean
probability
you
know
like
two
to
one
three
to
one
five
to
four
against
it
said
two
to
the
power
of
one
hundred
thousand
to
one
against
that's
pretty
improbable
you
know
a
milliongallon
vat
of
custard
upended
itself
over
them
without
warning
but
what
does
it
mean
cried
arthur
what
the
custard
no
the
measurement
of
probability
i
don't
know
i
don't
know
at
all
i
think
we're
on
some
kind
of
spaceship
i
can
only
assume
said
arthur
that
this
is
not
the
first
class
compartment
bulges
appeared
in
the
fabric
of
spacetime
great
ugly
bulges
haaaauuurrgghhh
said
arthur
as
he
felt
his
body
softening
and
bending
in
unusual
directions
southend
seems
to
be
melting
away
the
stars
are
swirling
a
dustbowl
my
legs
are
drifting
off
into
the
sunset
my
left
arm's
come
off
too
a
frightening
thought
struck
him
hell
he
said
how
am
i
going
to
operate
my
digital
watch
now
he
wound
his
eyes
desperately
around
in
ford's
direction
ford
he
said
you're
turning
into
a
penguin
stop
it
again
came
the
voice
two
to
the
power
of
seventyfive
thousand
to
one
against
and
falling
ford
waddled
around
his
pond
in
a
furious
circle
hey
who
are
you
he
quacked
where
are
you
what's
going
on
and
is
there
any
way
of
stopping
it
please
relax
said
the
voice
pleasantly
like
a
stewardess
in
an
airliner
with
only
one
wing
and
two
engines
one
of
which
is
on
fire
you
are
perfectly
safe
but
that's
not
the
point
raged
ford
the
point
is
that
i
am
now
a
perfectly
save
penguin
and
my
colleague
here
is
rapidly
running
out
of
limbs
it's
alright
i've
got
them
back
now
said
arthur
two
to
the
power
of
fifty
thousand
to
one
against
and
falling
said
the
voice
admittedly
said
arthur
they're
longer
than
i
usually
like
them
but
isn't
there
anything
squawked
ford
in
avian
fury
you
feel
you
ought
to
be
telling
us
the
voice
cleared
its
throat
a
giant
petit
four
lolloped
off
into
the
distance
welcome
the
voice
said
to
the
starship
heart
of
gold
the
voice
continued
please
do
not
be
alarmed
it
said
by
anything
you
see
or
hear
around
you
you
are
bound
to
feel
some
initial
ill
effects
as
you
have
been
rescued
from
certain
death
at
an
improbability
level
of
two
to
the
power
of
two
hundred
and
seventysix
thousand
to
one
against
possibly
much
higher
we
are
now
cruising
at
a
level
of
two
to
the
power
of
twentyfive
thousand
to
one
against
and
falling
and
we
will
be
restoring
normality
just
as
soon
as
we
are
sure
what
is
normal
anyway
thank
you
two
to
the
power
of
twenty
thousand
to
one
against
and
falling
the
voice
cut
out
ford
and
arthur
were
in
a
small
luminous
pink
cubicle
ford
was
wildly
excited
arthur
he
said
this
is
fantastic
we've
been
picked
up
by
a
ship
powered
by
the
infinite
improbability
drive
this
is
incredible
i
heard
rumors
about
it
before
they
were
all
officially
denied
but
they
must
have
done
it
they've
built
the
improbability
drive
arthur
this
is
arthur
what's
happening
arthur
had
jammed
himself
against
the
door
to
the
cubicle
trying
to
hold
it
closed
but
it
was
ill
fitting
tiny
furry
little
hands
were
squeezing
themselves
through
the
cracks
their
fingers
were
inkstained
tiny
voices
chattered
insanely
arthur
looked
up
ford
he
said
there's
an
infinite
number
of
monkeys
outside
who
want
to
talk
to
us
about
this
script
for
hamlet
they've
worked
out
chapter
the
infinite
improbability
drive
is
a
wonderful
new
method
of
crossing
vast
interstellar
distances
in
a
mere
nothingth
of
a
second
without
all
that
tedious
mucking
about
in
hyperspace
it
was
discovered
by
a
lucky
chance
and
then
developed
into
a
governable
form
of
propulsion
by
the
galactic
government's
research
team
on
damogran
this
briefly
is
the
story
of
its
discovery
the
principle
of
generating
small
amounts
of
finite
improbability
by
simply
hooking
the
logic
circuits
of
a
bambleweeny
sub
meson
brain
to
an
atomic
vector
plotter
suspended
in
a
strong
brownian
motion
producer
say
a
nice
hot
cup
of
tea
were
of
course
well
understood
and
such
generators
were
often
used
to
break
the
ice
at
parties
by
making
all
the
molecules
in
the
hostess's
undergarments
leap
simultaneously
one
foot
to
the
left
in
accordance
with
the
theory
of
indeterminacy
many
respectable
physicists
said
that
they
weren't
going
to
stand
for
this
partly
because
it
was
a
debasement
of
science
but
mostly
because
they
didn't
get
invited
to
those
sort
of
parties
another
thing
they
couldn't
stand
was
the
perpetual
failure
they
encountered
in
trying
to
construct
a
machine
which
could
generate
the
infinite
improbability
field
needed
to
flip
a
spaceship
across
the
mindparalysing
distances
between
the
furthest
stars
and
in
the
end
they
grumpily
announced
that
such
a
machine
was
virtually
impossible
then
one
day
a
student
who
had
been
left
to
sweep
up
the
lab
after
a
particularly
unsuccessful
party
found
himself
reasoning
this
way
if
he
thought
to
himself
such
a
machine
is
a
virtual
impossibility
then
it
must
logically
be
a
finite
improbability
so
all
i
have
to
do
in
order
to
make
one
is
to
work
out
exactly
how
improbable
it
is
feed
that
figure
into
the
finite
improbability
generator
give
it
a
fresh
cup
of
really
hot
tea
and
turn
it
on
he
did
this
and
was
rather
startled
to
discover
that
he
had
managed
to
create
the
long
sought
after
golden
infinite
improbability
generator
out
of
thin
air
it
startled
him
even
more
when
just
after
he
was
awarded
the
galactic
institute's
prize
for
extreme
cleverness
he
got
lynched
by
a
rampaging
mob
of
respectable
physicists
who
had
finally
realized
that
the
one
thing
they
really
couldn't
stand
was
a
smartass
chapter
the
improbabilityproof
control
cabin
of
the
heart
of
gold
looked
like
a
perfectly
conventional
spaceship
except
that
it
was
perfectly
clean
because
it
was
so
new
some
of
the
control
seats
hadn't
had
the
plastic
wrapping
taken
off
yet
the
cabin
was
mostly
white
oblong
and
about
the
size
of
a
smallish
restaurant
in
fact
it
wasn't
perfectly
oblong
the
two
long
walls
were
raked
round
in
a
slight
parallel
curve
and
all
the
angles
and
corners
were
contoured
in
excitingly
chunky
shapes
the
truth
of
the
matter
is
that
it
would
have
been
a
great
deal
simpler
and
more
practical
to
build
the
cabin
as
an
ordinary
threedimensional
oblong
rom
but
then
the
designers
would
have
got
miserable
as
it
was
the
cabin
looked
excitingly
purposeful
with
large
video
screens
ranged
over
the
control
and
guidance
system
panels
on
the
concave
wall
and
long
banks
of
computers
set
into
the
convex
wall
in
one
corner
a
robot
sat
humped
its
gleaming
brushed
steel
head
hanging
loosely
between
its
gleaming
brushed
steel
knees
it
too
was
fairly
new
but
though
it
was
beautifully
constructed
and
polished
it
somehow
looked
as
if
the
various
parts
of
its
more
or
less
humanoid
body
didn't
quite
fit
properly
in
fact
they
fitted
perfectly
well
but
something
in
its
bearing
suggested
that
they
might
have
fitted
better
zaphod
beeblebrox
paced
nervously
up
and
down
the
cabin
brushing
his
hands
over
pieces
of
gleaming
equipment
and
giggling
with
excitement
trillian
sat
hunched
over
a
clump
of
instruments
reading
off
figures
her
voice
was
carried
round
the
tannoy
system
of
the
whole
ship
five
to
one
against
and
falling
she
said
four
to
one
against
and
falling
three
to
one
two
one
probability
factor
of
one
to
one
we
have
normality
i
repeat
we
have
normality
she
turned
her
microphone
off
then
turned
it
back
on
with
a
slight
smile
and
continued
anything
you
still
can't
cope
with
is
therefore
your
own
problem
please
relax
you
will
be
sent
for
soon
zaphod
burst
out
in
annoyance
who
are
they
trillian
trillian
span
her
seat
round
to
face
him
and
shrugged
just
a
couple
of
guys
we
seem
to
have
picked
up
in
open
space
she
said
section
zz
plural
z
alpha
yeah
well
that's
a
very
sweet
thought
trillian
complained
zaphod
but
do
you
really
think
it's
wise
under
the
circumstances
i
mean
here
we
are
on
the
run
and
everything
we
must
have
the
police
of
half
the
galaxy
after
us
by
now
and
we
stop
to
pick
up
hitch
hikers
ok
so
ten
out
of
ten
for
style
but
minus
several
million
for
good
thinking
yeah
he
tapped
irritably
at
a
control
panel
trillian
quietly
moved
his
hand
before
he
tapped
anything
important
whatever
zaphod's
qualities
of
mind
might
include
dash
bravado
conceit
he
was
mechanically
inept
and
could
easily
blow
the
ship
up
with
an
extravagant
gesture
trillian
had
come
to
suspect
that
the
main
reason
why
he
had
had
such
a
wild
and
successful
life
that
he
never
really
understood
the
significance
of
anything
he
did
zaphod
she
said
patiently
they
were
floating
unprotected
in
open
space
you
wouldn't
want
them
to
have
died
would
you
well
you
know
no
not
as
such
but
not
as
such
not
die
as
such
but
trillian
cocked
her
head
on
one
side
well
maybe
someone
else
might
have
picked
them
up
later
a
second
later
and
they
would
have
been
dead
yeah
so
if
you'd
taken
the
trouble
to
think
about
the
problem
a
bit
longer
it
would
have
gone
away
you'd
been
happy
to
let
them
die
well
you
know
not
happy
as
such
but
anyway
said
trillian
turning
back
to
the
controls
i
didn't
pick
them
up
what
do
you
mean
who
picked
them
up
then
the
ship
did
huh
the
ship
did
all
by
itself
huh
whilst
we
were
in
improbability
drive
but
that's
incredible
no
zaphod
just
very
very
improbable
er
yeah
look
zaphod
she
said
patting
his
arm
don't
worry
about
the
aliens
they're
just
a
couple
of
guys
i
expect
i'll
send
the
robot
down
to
get
them
and
bring
them
up
here
hey
marvin
in
the
corner
the
robot's
head
swung
up
sharply
but
then
wobbled
about
imperceptibly
it
pulled
itself
up
to
its
feet
as
if
it
was
about
five
pounds
heavier
that
it
actually
was
and
made
what
an
outside
observer
would
have
thought
was
a
heroic
effort
to
cross
the
room
it
stopped
in
front
of
trillian
and
seemed
to
stare
through
her
left
shoulder
i
think
you
ought
to
know
i'm
feeling
very
depressed
it
said
its
voice
was
low
and
hopeless
oh
god
muttered
zaphod
and
slumped
into
a
seat
well
said
trillian
in
a
bright
compassionate
tone
here's
something
to
occupy
you
and
keep
your
mind
off
things
it
won't
work
droned
marvin
i
have
an
exceptionally
large
mind
marvin
warned
trillian
alright
said
marvin
what
do
you
want
me
to
do
go
down
to
number
two
entry
bay
and
bring
the
two
aliens
up
here
under
surveillance
with
a
microsecond
pause
and
a
finely
calculated
micromodulation
of
pitch
and
timbre
nothing
you
could
actually
take
offence
at
marvin
managed
to
convey
his
utter
contempt
and
horror
of
all
things
human
just
that
he
said
yes
said
trillian
firmly
i
won't
enjoy
it
said
marvin
zaphod
leaped
out
of
his
seat
she's
not
asking
you
to
enjoy
it
he
shouted
just
do
it
will
you
alright
said
marvin
like
the
tolling
of
a
great
cracked
bell
i'll
do
it
good
snapped
zaphod
great
thank
you
marvin
turned
and
lifted
his
flattopped
triangular
red
eyes
up
towards
him
i'm
not
getting
you
down
at
all
am
i
he
said
pathetically
no
no
marvin
lilted
trillian
that's
just
fine
really
i
wouldn't
like
to
think
that
i
was
getting
you
down
no
don't
worry
about
that
the
lilt
continued
you
just
act
as
comes
naturally
and
everything
will
be
just
fine
you're
sure
you
don't
mind
probed
marvin
no
no
marvin
lilted
trillian
that's
just
fine
really
just
part
of
life
marvin
flashed
him
an
electronic
look
life
said
marvin
don't
talk
to
me
about
life
he
turned
hopelessly
on
his
heel
and
lugged
himself
out
of
the
cabin
with
a
satisfied
hum
and
a
click
the
door
closed
behind
him
i
don't
think
i
can
stand
that
robot
much
longer
zaphod
growled
trillian

ford
and

found
themselves
in

embarkation
area
of
the
ship
it
was
rather
smart
i
think
the

brand

said
ford
how
can
you
tell
asked
arthur
have
you
got
some
exotic
device
for

i
just
found

ah
look
i
was
right
ford
jabbed
at

and
showed
it
to
arthur
it
says
sensational
new
breakthrough
in

as

reaches

be
the
envy
of
other
major
governments
wow
this
is
big
league
stuff
ford
hunted
excitedly
through
the
technical
specs
of
the
ship
occasionally
gasping
with
astonishment
at
what
he
read
clearly
galactic
astrotechnology
had
moved
ahead
during
the
years
of
his
exile
arthur
listened
for
a
short
while
but
being
unable
to
understand
the
vast
majority
of
what
ford
was
saying
he
began
to
let
his
mind
wander
trailing
his
fingers
along
the
edge
of
an
incomprehensible
computer
bank
he
reached
out
and
pressed
an
invitingly
large
red
button
on
a
nearby
panel
the
panel
lit
up
with
the
words
please
do
not
press
this
button
again
he
shook
himself
listen
said
ford
who
was
still
engrossed
in
the
sales
brochure
they
make
a
big
thing
of
the
ship's
cybernetics
a
new
generation
of
sirius
cybernetics
corporation
robots
and
computers
with
the
new
gpp
feature
gpp
feature
said
arthur
what's
that
oh
it
says
genuine
people
personalities
oh
said
arthur
sounds
ghastly
a
voice
behind
them
said
it
is
the
voice
was
low
and
hopeless
and
accompanied
by
a
slight
clanking
sound
they
span
round
and
saw
an
abject
steel
man
standing
hunched
in
the
doorway
what
they
said
ghastly
continued
marvin
it
all
is
absolutely
ghastly
just
don't
even
talk
about
it
look
at
this
door
he
said
stepping
through
it
the
irony
circuits
cut
into
his
voice
modulator
as
he
mimicked
the
style
of
the
sales
brochure
all
the
doors
in
this
spaceship
have
a
cheerful
and
sunny
disposition
it
is
their
pleasure
to
open
for
you
and
their
satisfaction
to
close
again
with
the
knowledge
of
a
job
well
done
as
the
door
closed
behind
them
it
became
apparent
that
it
did
indeed
have
a
satisfied
sighlike
quality
to
it
hummmmmmmyummmmmmm
ah
it
said
marvin
regarded
it
with
cold
loathing
whilst
his
logic
circuits
chattered
with
disgust
and
tinkered
with
the
concept
of
directing
physical
violence
against
it
further
circuits
cut
in
saying
why
bother
what's
the
point
nothing
is
worth
getting
involved
in
further
circuits
amused
themselves
by
analysing
the
molecular
components
of
the
door
and
of
the
humanoids
brain
cells
for
a
quick
encore
they
measured
the
level
of
hydrogen
emissions
in
the
surrounding
cubic
parsec
of
space
and
then
shut
down
again
in
boredom
a
spasm
of
despair
shook
the
robot's
body
as
he
turned
come
on
he
droned
i've
been
ordered
to
take
you
down
to
the
bridge
here
i
am
brain
the
size
of
a
planet
and
they
ask
me
to
take
you
down
to
the
bridge
call
that
job
satisfaction
cos
i
don't
he
turned
and
walked
back
to
the
hated
door
er
excuse
me
said
ford
following
after
him
which
government
owns
this
ship
marvin
ignored
him
you
watch
this
door
he
muttered
it's
about
to
open
again
i
can
tell
by
the
intolerable
air
of
smugness
it
suddenly
generates
with
an
ingratiating
little
whine
the
door
slit
open
again
and
marvin
stomped
through
come
on
he
said
the
others
followed
quickly
and
the
door
slit
back
into
place
with
pleased
little
clicks
and
whirrs
thank
you
the
marketing
division
of
the
sirius
cybernetics
corporation
said
marvin
and
trudged
desolately
up
the
gleaming
curved
corridor
that
stretched
out
before
them
let's
build
robots
with
genuine
people
personalities
they
said
so
they
tried
it
out
with
me
i'm
a
personality
prototype
you
can
tell
can't
you
ford
and
arthur
muttered
embarrassed
little
disclaimers
i
hate
that
door
continued
marvin
i'm
not
getting
you
down
at
all
am
i
which
government
started
ford
again
no
government
owns
it
snapped
the
robot
it's
been
stolen
stolen
stolen
mimicked
marvin
who
by
asked
ford
zaphod
beeblebrox
something
extraordinary
happened
to
ford's
face
at
least
five
entirely
separate
and
distinct
expressions
of
shock
and
amazement
piled
up
on
it
in
a
jumbled
mess
his
left
leg
which
was
in
mid
stride
seemed
to
have
difficulty
in
finding
the
floor
again
he
stared
at
the
robot
and
tried
to
entangle
some
dartoid
muscles
zaphod
beeblebrox
he
said
weakly
sorry
did
i
say
something
wrong
said
marvin
dragging
himself
on
regardless
pardon
me
for
breathing
which
i
never
do
anyway
so
i
don't
know
why
i
bother
to
say
it
oh
god
i'm
so
depressed
here's
another
of
those
selfsatisfied
door
life
don't
talk
to
me
about
life
no
one
ever
mentioned
it
muttered
arthur
irritably
ford
are
you
alright
ford
stared
at
him
did
that
robot
say
zaphod
beeblebrox
he
said
chapter
a
loud
clatter
of
gunk
music
flooded
through
the
heart
of
gold
cabin
as
zaphod
searched
the
subetha
radio
wavebands
for
news
of
himself
the
machine
was
rather
difficult
to
operate
for
years
radios
had
been
operated
by
means
of
pressing
buttons
and
turning
dials
then
as
the
technology
became
more
sophisticated
the
controls
were
made
touchsensitive
you
merely
had
to
brush
the
panels
with
your
fingers
now
all
you
had
to
do
was
wave
your
hand
in
the
general
direction
of
the
components
and
hope
it
saved
a
lot
of
muscular
expenditure
of
course
but
meant
that
you
had
to
sit
infuriatingly
still
if
you
wanted
to
keep
listening
to
the
same
programme
zaphod
waved
a
hand
and
the
channel
switched
again
more
gunk
music
but
this
time
it
was
a
background
to
a
news
announcement
the
news
was
always
heavily
edited
to
fit
the
rhythms
of
the
music
and
news
brought
to
you
here
on
the
subetha
wave
band
broadcasting
around
the
galaxy
around
the
clock
squawked
a
voice
and
we'll
be
saying
a
big
hello
to
all
intelligent
life
forms
everywhere
and
to
everyone
else
out
there
the
secret
is
to
bang
the
rocks
together
guys
and
of
course
the
big
news
story
tonight
is
the
sensational
theft
of
the
new
improbability
drive
prototype
ship
by
none
other
than
galactic
president
zaphod
beeblebrox
and
the
question
everyone's
asking
is
has
the
big
z
finally
flipped
beeblebrox
the
man
who
invented
the
pan
galactic
gargle
blaster
exconfidence
trickster
once
described
by
eccentrica
gallumbits
as
the
best
bang
since
the
big
one
and
recently
voted
the
wort
dressed
sentinent
being
in
the
known
universe
for
the
seventh
time
has
he
got
an
answer
this
time
we
asked
his
private
brain
care
specialist
gag
halfrunt
the
music
swirled
and
dived
for
a
moment
another
voice
broke
in
presumably
halfrunt
he
said
vell
zaphod's
jist
zis
guy
you
know
but
got
no
further
because
an
electric
pencil
flew
across
the
cabin
and
through
the
radio's
onoff
sensitive
airspace
zaphod
turned
and
glared
at
trillian
she
had
thrown
the
pencil
hey
he
said
what
do
you
do
that
for
trillian
was
tapping
her
fingers
on
a
screenful
of
figures
i've
just
thought
of
something
she
said
yeah
worth
interrupting
a
news
bulletin
about
me
for
you
hear
enough
about
yourself
as
it
is
i'm
very
insecure
we
know
that
can
we
drop
your
ego
for
a
moment
this
is
important
if
there's
anything
more
important
than
my
ego
around
i
want
it
caught
and
shot
now
zaphod
glared
at
her
again
then
laughed
listen
she
said
we
picked
up
those
couple
of
guys
what
couple
of
guys
the
couple
of
guys
we
picked
up
oh
yeah
said
zaphod
those
couple
of
guys
we
picked
them
up
in
sector
zz
plural
z
alpha
yeah
said
zaphod
and
blinked
trillian
said
quietly
does
that
mean
anything
to
you
mmmmm
said
zaphod
zz
plural
z
alpha
zz
plural
z
alpha
well
said
trillian
er
what
does
the
z
mean
said
zaphod
which
one
any
one
one
of
the
major
difficulties
trillian
experienced
in
her
relationship
with
zaphod
was
learning
to
distinguish
between
him
pretending
to
be
stupid
just
to
get
people
off
their
guard
pretending
to
be
stupid
because
he
couldn't
be
bothered
to
think
and
wanted
someone
else
to
do
it
for
him
pretending
to
be
outrageously
stupid
to
hide
the
fact
that
he
actually
didn't
understand
what
was
going
on
and
really
being
genuinely
stupid
he
was
renowned
for
being
amazingly
clever
and
quite
clearly
was
so
but
not
all
the
time
which
obviously
worried
him
hence
the
act
he
proffered
people
to
be
puzzled
rather
than
contemptuous
this
above
all
appeared
to
trillian
to
be
genuinely
stupid
but
she
could
no
longer
be
bothered
to
argue
about
it
she
sighed
and
punched
up
a
star
map
on
the
visiscreen
so
she
could
make
it
simple
for
him
whatever
his
reasons
for
wanting
it
to
be
that
way
there
she
pointed
right
there
hey
yeah
said
zaphod
well
she
said
well
what
parts
of
the
inside
of
her
head
screamed
at
other
parts
of
the
inside
of
her
head
she
said
very
calmly
it's
the
same
sector
you
originally
picked
me
up
in
he
looked
at
her
and
then
looked
back
at
the
screen
hey
yeah
he
said
now
that
is
wild
we
should
have
zapped
straight
into
the
middle
of
the
horsehead
nebula
how
did
we
come
to
be
there
i
mean
that's
nowhere
she
ignored
this
improbability
drive
she
said
patiently
you
explained
it
to
me
yourself
we
pass
through
every
point
in
the
universe
you
know
that
yeah
but
that's
one
wild
coincidence
isn't
it
yes
picking
someone
up
at
that
point
out
of
the
whole
of
the
universe
to
choose
from
that's
just
too
i
want
to
work
this
out
computer
the
sirius
cybernetics
corporation
shipboard
computer
which
controlled
and
permeated
every
particle
of
the
ship
switched
into
communication
mode
hi
there
it
said
brightly
and
simultaneously
spewed
out
a
tiny
ribbon
of
ticker
tape
just
for
the
record
the
ticker
tape
said
hi
there
oh
god
said
zaphod
he
hadn't
worked
with
this
computer
for
long
but
had
already
learned
to
loathe
it
the
computer
continued
brash
and
cheery
as
if
it
was
selling
detergent
i
want
you
to
know
that
whatever
your
problem
i
am
here
to
help
you
solve
it
yeah
yeah
said
zaphod
look
i
think
i'll
just
use
a
piece
of
paper
sure
thing
said
the
computer
spilling
out
its
message
into
a
waste
bin
at
the
same
time
i
understand
if
you
ever
want
shut
up
said
zaphod
and
snatching
up
a
pencil
sat
down
next
to
trillian
at
the
console
ok
ok
said
the
computer
in
a
hurt
tone
of
voice
and
closed
down
its
speech
channel
again
zaphod
and
trillian
pored
over
the
figures
that
the
improbability
flight
path
scanner
flashed
silently
up
in
front
of
them
can
we
work
out
said
zaphod
from
their
point
of
view
what
the
improbability
of
their
rescue
was
yes
that's
a
constant
said
trillian
two
to
the
power
of
two
hundred
and
seventysix
thousand
seven
hundred
and
nine
to
one
against
that's
high
they're
two
lucky
lucky
guys
yes
but
relative
to
what
we
were
doing
when
the
ship
picked
them
up
trillian
punched
up
the
figures
they
showed
towtothe
power
ofinfinityminusone
an
irrational
number
that
only
has
a
conventional
meaning
in
improbability
physics
it's
pretty
low
continued
zaphod
with
a
slight
whistle
yes
agreed
trillian
and
looked
at
him
quizzically
that's
one
big
whack
of
improbability
to
be
accounted
for
something
pretty
improbable
has
got
to
show
up
on
the
balance
sheet
if
it's
all
going
to
add
up
into
a
pretty
sum
zaphod
scribbled
a
few
sums
crossed
them
out
and
threw
the
pencil
away
bat's
dots
i
can't
work
it
out
well
zaphod
knocked
his
two
heads
together
in
irritation
and
gritted
his
teeth
ok
he
said
computer
the
voice
circuits
sprang
to
life
again
why
hello
there
they
said
ticker
tape
ticker
tape
all
i
want
to
do
is
make
your
day
nicer
and
nicer
and
nicer
yeah
well
shut
up
and
work
something
out
for
me
sure
thing
chattered
the
computer
you
want
a
probability
forecast
based
on
improbability
data
yeah
ok
the
computer
continued
here's
an
interesting
little
notion
did
you
realize
that
most
people's
lives
are
governed
by
telephone
numbers
a
pained
look
crawled
across
one
of
zaphod's
faces
and
on
to
the
other
one
have
you
flipped
he
said
no
but
you
will
when
i
tell
you
that
trillian
gasped
she
scrabbled
at
the
buttons
on
the
improbability
flight
path
screen
telephone
number
she
said
did
that
thing
say
telephone
number
numbers
flashed
up
on
the
screen
the
computer
had
paused
politely
but
now
it
continued
what
i
was
about
to
say
was
that
don't
bother
please
said
trillian
look
what
is
this
said
zaphod
i
don't
know
said
trillian
but
those
aliens
they're
on
the
way
up
to
the
bridge
with
that
wretched
robot
can
we
pick
them
up
on
any
monitor
cameras
chapter
marvin
trudged
on
down
the
corridor
still
moaning
and
then
of
course
i've
got
this
terrible
pain
in
all
the
diodes
down
my
left
hand
side
no
said
arthur
grimly
as
he
walked
along
beside
him
really
oh
yes
said
marvin
i
mean
i've
asked
for
them
to
be
replaced
but
no
one
ever
listens
i
can
imagine
vague
whistling
and
humming
noises
were
coming
from
ford
well
well
well
he
kept
saying
to
himself
zaphod
beeblebrox
suddenly
marvin
stopped
and
held
up
a
hand
you
know
what's
happened
now
of
course
no
what
said
arthur
who
didn't
what
to
know
we've
arrived
at
another
of
those
doors
there
was
a
sliding
door
let
into
the
side
of
the
corridor
marvin
eyed
it
suspiciously
well
said
ford
impatiently
do
we
go
through
do
we
go
through
mimicked
marvin
yes
this
is
the
entrance
to
the
bridge
i
was
told
to
take
you
to
the
bridge
probably
the
highest
demand
that
will
be
made
on
my
intellectual
capacities
today
i
shouldn't
wonder
slowly
with
great
loathing
he
stepped
towards
the
door
like
a
hunter
stalking
his
prey
suddenly
it
slid
open
thank
you
it
said
for
making
a
simple
door
very
happy
deep
in
marvin's
thorax
gears
ground
funny
he
intoned
funerally
how
just
when
you
think
life
can't
possibly
get
any
worse
it
suddenly
does
he
heaved
himself
through
the
door
and
left
ford
and
arthur
staring
at
each
other
and
shrugging
their
shoulders
from
inside
they
heard
marvin's
voice
again
i
suppose
you
want
to
see
the
aliens
now
he
said
do
you
want
me
to
sit
in
a
corner
and
rust
or
just
fall
apart
where
i'm
standing
yeah
just
show
them
in
would
you
marvin
came
another
voice
arthur
looked
at
ford
and
was
astonished
to
see
him
laughing
what's
shhh
said
ford
come
in
he
stepped
through
into
the
bridge
arthur
followed
him
in
nervously
and
was
astonished
to
see
a
man
lolling
back
in
a
chair
with
his
feet
on
a
control
console
picking
the
teeth
in
his
righthand
head
with
his
left
hand
the
righthand
head
seemed
to
be
thoroughly
preoccupied
with
this
task
but
the
lefthand
one
was
grinning
a
broad
relaxed
nonchalant
grin
the
number
of
things
that
arthur
couldn't
believe
he
was
seeing
was
fairly
large
his
jaw
flapped
about
at
a
loose
end
for
a
while
the
peculiar
man
waved
a
lazy
wave
at
ford
and
with
an
appalling
affectation
of
nonchalance
said
ford
hi
how
are
you
glad
you
could
drop
in
ford
was
not
going
to
be
outcooled
zaphod
he
drawled
great
to
see
you
you're
looking
well
the
extra
arm
suits
you
nice
ship
you've
stolen
arthur
goggled
at
him
you
mean
you
know
this
guy
he
said
waving
a
wild
finger
at
zaphod
know
him
exclaimed
ford
he's
he
paused
and
decided
to
do
the
introductions
the
other
way
round
oh
zaphod
this
is
a
friend
of
mine
arthur
dent
he
said
i
saved
him
when
his
planet
blew
up
oh
sure
said
zaphod
hi
arthur
glad
you
could
make
it
his
righthand
head
looked
round
casually
said
hi
and
went
back
to
having
his
teeth
picked
ford
carried
on
and
arthur
he
said
this
is
my
semicousin
zaphod
beeb
we've
met
said
arthur
sharply
when
you're
cruising
down
the
road
in
the
fast
lane
and
you
lazily
sail
past
a
few
hard
driving
cars
and
are
feeling
pretty
pleased
with
yourself
and
then
accidentally
change
down
from
fourth
to
first
instead
of
third
thus
making
your
engine
leap
out
of
your
bonnet
in
a
rather
ugly
mess
it
tends
to
throw
you
off
your
stride
in
much
the
same
way
that
this
remark
threw
ford
prefect
off
his
err
what
i
said
we've
met
zaphod
gave
an
awkward
start
of
surprise
and
jabbed
a
gum
sharply
hey
er
have
we
hey
er
ford
rounded
on
arthur
with
an
angry
flash
in
his
eyes
now
he
felt
he
was
back
on
home
ground
he
suddenly
began
to
resent
having
lumbered
himself
with
this
ignorant
primitive
who
knew
as
much
about
the
affairs
of
the
galaxy
as
an
ilfordbased
gnat
knew
about
life
in
peking
what
do
you
mean
you've
met
he
demanded
this
is
zaphod
beeblebrox
from
betelgeuse
five
you
know
not
bloody
martin
smith
from
croydon
i
don't
care
said
arthur
coldly
we've
met
haven't
we
zaphod
beeblebrox
or
should
i
say
phil
what
shouted
ford
you'll
have
to
remind
me
said
zaphod
i've
a
terrible
memory
for
species
it
was
at
a
party
pursued
arthur
yeah
well
i
doubt
that
said
zaphod
cool
it
will
you
arthur
demanded
ford
arthur
would
not
be
deterred
a
party
six
months
ago
on
earth
england
zaphod
shook
his
head
with
a
tightlipped
smile
london
insisted
arthur
islington
oh
said
zaphod
with
a
guilty
start
that
party
this
wasn't
fair
on
ford
at
all
he
looked
backwards
and
forwards
between
arthur
and
zaphod
what
he
said
to
zaphod
you
don't
mean
to
say
you've
been
on
that
miserable
planet
as
well
do
you
no
of
course
not
said
zaphod
breezily
well
i
may
have
just
dropped
in
briefly
you
know
on
my
way
somewhere
but
i
was
stuck
there
for
fifteen
years
well
i
didn't
know
that
did
i
but
what
were
you
doing
there
looking
about
you
know
he
gatecrashed
a
party
persisted
arthur
trembling
with
anger
a
fancy
dress
party
it
would
have
to
be
wouldn't
it
said
ford
at
this
party
persisted
arthur
was
a
girl
oh
well
look
it
doesn't
matter
now
the
whole
place
has
gone
up
in
smoke
anyway
i
wish
you'd
stop
sulking
about
that
bloody
planet
said
ford
who
was
the
lady
oh
just
somebody
well
alright
i
wasn't
doing
very
well
with
her
i'd
been
trying
all
evening
hell
she
was
something
though
beautiful
charming
devastatingly
intelligent
at
last
i'd
got
her
to
myself
for
a
bit
and
was
plying
her
with
a
bit
of
talk
when
this
friend
of
yours
barges
up
and
says
hey
doll
is
this
guy
boring
you
why
don't
you
talk
to
me
instead
i'm
from
a
different
planet
i
never
saw
her
again
zaphod
exclaimed
ford
yes
said
arthur
glaring
at
him
and
trying
not
to
feel
foolish
he
only
had
the
two
arms
and
the
one
head
and
he
called
himself
phil
but
but
you
must
admit
he
did
turn
out
to
be
from
another
planet
said
trillian
wandering
into
sight
at
the
other
end
of
the
bridge
she
gave
arthur
a
pleasant
smile
which
settled
on
him
like
a
ton
of
bricks
and
then
turned
her
attention
to
the
ship's
controls
again
there
was
silence
for
a
few
seconds
and
then
out
of
the
scrambled
mess
of
arthur's
brain
crawled
some
words
tricia
mcmillian
he
said
what
are
you
doing
here
same
as
you
she
said
i
hitched
a
lift
after
all
with
a
degree
in
maths
and
another
in
astrophysics
what
else
was
there
to
do
it
was
either
that
or
the
dole
queue
again
on
monday
infinity
minus
one
chattered
the
computer
improbability
sum
now
complete
zaphod
looked
about
him
at
ford
at
arthur
and
then
at
trillian
trillian
he
said
is
this
sort
of
thing
going
to
happen
every
time
we
use
the
improbability
drive
very
probably
i'm
afraid
she
said
chapter
the
heart
of
gold
fled
on
silently
through
the
night
of
space
now
on
conventional
photon
drive
its
crew
of
four
were
ill
at
ease
knowing
that
they
had
been
brought
together
not
of
their
own
volition
or
by
simple
coincidence
but
by
some
curious
principle
of
physics
as
if
relationships
between
people
were
susceptible
to
the
same
laws
that
governed
the
relationships
between
atoms
and
molecules
as
the
ship's
artificial
night
closed
in
they
were
each
grateful
to
retire
to
separate
cabins
and
try
to
rationalize
their
thoughts
trillian
couldn't
sleep
she
sat
on
a
couch
and
stared
at
a
small
cage
which
contained
her
last
and
only
links
with
earth
two
white
mice
that
she
had
insisted
zaphod
let
her
bring
she
had
expected
not
to
see
the
planet
again
but
she
was
disturbed
by
her
negative
reaction
to
the
planet's
destruction
it
seemed
remote
and
unreal
and
she
could
find
no
thoughts
to
think
about
it
she
watched
the
mice
scurrying
round
the
cage
and
running
furiously
in
their
little
plastic
treadwheels
till
they
occupied
her
whole
attention
suddenly
she
shook
herself
and
went
back
to
the
bridge
to
watch
over
the
tiny
flashing
lights
and
figures
that
charted
the
ship's
progress
through
the
void
she
wished
she
knew
what
it
was
she
was
trying
not
to
think
about
zaphod
couldn't
sleep
he
also
wished
he
knew
what
it
was
that
he
wouldn't
let
himself
think
about
for
as
long
as
he
could
remember
he'd
suffered
from
a
vague
nagging
feeling
of
being
not
all
there
most
of
the
time
he
was
able
to
put
this
thought
aside
and
not
worry
about
it
but
it
had
been
reawakened
by
the
sudden
inexplicable
arrival
of
ford
prefect
and
arthur
dent
somehow
it
seemed
to
conform
to
a
pattern
that
he
couldn't
see
ford
couldn't
sleep
he
was
too
excited
about
being
back
on
the
road
again
fifteen
years
of
virtual
imprisonment
were
over
just
as
he
was
finally
beginning
to
give
up
hope
knocking
about
with
zaphod
for
a
bit
promised
to
be
a
lot
of
fun
though
there
seemed
to
be
something
faintly
odd
about
his
semicousin
that
he
couldn't
put
his
finger
on
the
fact
that
he
had
become
president
of
the
galaxy
was
frankly
astonishing
as
was
the
manner
of
his
leaving
the
post
was
there
a
reason
behind
it
there
would
be
no
point
in
asking
zaphod
he
never
appeared
to
have
a
reason
for
anything
he
did
at
all
he
had
turned
unfathomably
into
an
art
form
he
attacked
everything
in
life
with
a
mixture
of
extraordinary
genius
and
naive
incompetence
and
it
was
often
difficult
to
tell
which
was
which
arthur
slept
he
was
terribly
tired
there
was
a
tap
at
zaphod's
door
it
slid
open
zaphod
yeah
i
think
we
just
found
what
you
came
to
look
for
hey
yeah
ford
gave
up
the
attempt
to
sleep
in
the
corner
of
his
cabin
was
a
small
computer
screen
and
keyboard
he
sat
at
it
for
a
while
and
tried
to
compose
a
new
entry
for
the
guide
on
the
subject
of
vogons
but
couldn't
think
of
anything
vitriolic
enough
so
he
gave
that
up
too
wrapped
a
robe
round
himself
and
went
for
a
walk
to
the
bridge
as
he
entered
he
was
surprised
to
see
two
figures
hunched
excitedly
over
the
instruments
see
the
ship's
about
to
move
into
orbit
trillian
was
saying
there's
a
planet
out
there
it's
at
the
exact
coordinates
you
predicted
zaphod
heard
a
noise
and
looked
up
ford
he
hissed
hey
come
and
take
a
look
at
this
ford
went
and
had
a
look
at
it
it
was
a
series
of
figures
flashing
over
a
screen
you
recognize
those
galactic
coordinates
said
zaphod
no
i'll
give
you
a
clue
computer
hi
gang
enthused
the
computer
this
is
getting
real
sociable
isn't
it
shut
up
said
zaphod
and
show
up
the
screens
light
on
the
bridge
sank
pinpoints
of
light
played
across
the
consoles
and
reflected
in
four
pairs
of
eyes
that
stared
up
at
the
external
monitor
screens
there
was
absolutely
nothing
on
them
recognize
that
whispered
zaphod
ford
frowned
er
no
he
said
what
do
you
see
nothing
recognize
it
what
are
you
talking
about
we're
in
the
horsehead
nebula
one
whole
vast
dark
cloud
and
i
was
meant
to
recognize
that
from
a
blank
screen
inside
a
dark
nebula
is
the
only
place
in
the
galaxy
you'd
see
a
dark
screen
very
good
zaphod
laughed
he
was
clearly
very
excited
about
something
almost
childishly
so
hey
this
is
really
terrific
this
is
just
far
too
much
what's
so
great
about
being
stuck
in
a
dust
cloud
said
ford
what
would
you
reckon
to
find
here
urged
zaphod
nothing
no
stars
no
planets
no
computer
shouted
zaphod
rotate
angle
of
vision
through
one
eighty
degrees
and
don't
talk
about
it
for
a
moment
it
seemed
that
nothing
was
happening
then
a
brightness
glowed
at
the
edge
of
the
huge
screen
a
red
star
the
size
of
a
small
plate
crept
across
it
followed
quickly
by
another
one
a
binary
system
then
a
vast
crescent
sliced
into
the
corner
of
the
picture
a
red
glare
shading
away
into
the
deep
black
the
night
side
of
the
planet
i've
found
it
cried
zaphod
thumping
the
console
i've
found
it
ford
stared
at
it
in
astonishment
what
is
it
he
said
that
said
zaphod
is
the
most
improbable
planet
that
ever
existed

a
entry
magrathea
far
back
in
the
mists
of
ancient
time
in
the
great
and
glorious
days
of
the
former
galactic
empire
life
was
wild
rich
and
largely
tax
free
mighty
starships
plied
their
way
between
exotic
suns
seeking
adventure
and
reward
amongst
the
furthest
reaches
of
galactic
space
in
those
days
spirits
were
brave
the
stakes
were
high
men
were
real
men
women
were
real
women
and
small
furry
creatures
from
alpha
centauri
were
real
small
furry
creatures
from
alpha
centauri
and
all
dared
to
brave
unknown
terrors
to
do
mighty
deeds
to
boldly
split
infinitives
that
no
man
had
split
before
and
thus
was
the
empire
forged
many
men
of
course
became
extremely
rich
but
this
was
perfectly
natural
and
nothing
to
be
ashamed
of
because
no
one
was
really
poor
at
least
no
one
worth
speaking
of
and
for
all
the
richest
and
most
successful
merchants
life
inevitably
became
rather
dull
and
niggly
and
they
began
to
imagine
that
this
was
therefore
the
fault
of
the
worlds
they'd
settled
on
none
of
them
was
entirely
satisfactory
either
the
climate
wasn't
quite
right
in
the
later
part
of
the
afternoon
or
the
day
was
half
an
hour
too
long
or
the
sea
was
exactly
the
wrong
shade
of
pink
and
thus
were
created
the
conditions
for
a
staggering
new
form
of
specialist
industry
custommade
luxury
planet
building
the
home
of
this
industry
was
the
planet
magrathea
where
hyperspatial
engineers
sucked
matter
through
white
holes
in
space
to
form
it
into
dream
planets
gold
planets
platinum
planets
soft
rubber
planets
with
lots
of
earthquakes
all
lovingly
made
to
meet
the
exacting
standards
that
the
galaxy's
richest
men
naturally
came
to
expect
but
so
successful
was
this
venture
that
magrathea
itself
soon
became
the
richest
planet
of
all
time
and
the
rest
of
the
galaxy
was
reduced
to
abject
poverty
and
so
the
system
broke
down
the
empire
collapsed
and
a
long
sullen
silence
settled
over
a
billion
worlds
disturbed
only
by
the
pen
scratchings
of
scholars
as
they
laboured
into
the
night
over
smug
little
treaties
on
the
value
of
a
planned
political
economy
magrathea
itself
disappeared
and
its
memory
soon
passed
into
the
obscurity
of
legend
in
these
enlightened
days
of
course
no
one
believes
a
word
of
it
chapter
arthur
awoke
to
the
sound
of
argument
and
went
to
the
bridge
ford
was
waving
his
arms
about
you're
crazy
zaphod
he
was
saying
magrathea
is
a
myth
a
fairy
story
it's
what
parents
tell
their
kids
about
at
night
if
they
want
them
to
grow
up
to
become
economists
it's
and
that's
what
we
are
currently
in
orbit
around
insisted
zaphod
look
i
can't
help
what
you
may
personally
be
in
orbit
around
said
ford
but
this
ship
computer
shouted
zaphod
oh
no
hi
there
this
is
eddie
your
shipboard
computer
and
i'm
feeling
just
great
guys
and
i
know
i'm
just
going
to
get
a
bundle
of
kicks
out
of
any
programme
you
care
to
run
through
me
arthur
looked
inquiringly
at
trillian
she
motioned
him
to
come
on
in
but
keep
quiet
computer
said
zaphod
tell
us
again
what
our
present
trajectory
is
a
real
pleasure
feller
it
burbled
we
are
currently
in
orbit
at
an
altitude
of
three
hundred
miles
around
the
legendary
planet
of
magrathea
proving
nothing
said
ford
i
wouldn't
trust
that
computer
to
speak
my
weight
i
can
do
that
for
you
sure
enthused
the
computer
punching
out
more
tickertape
i
can
even
work
out
you
personality
problems
to
ten
decimal
places
if
it
will
help
trillian
interrupted
zaphod
she
said
any
minute
now
we
will
be
swinging
round
to
the
daylight
side
of
this
planet
adding
whatever
it
turns
out
to
be
hey
what
do
you
mean
by
that
the
planet's
where
i
predicted
it
would
be
isn't
it
yes
i
know
there's
a
planet
there
i'm
not
arguing
with
anyone
it's
just
that
i
wouldn't
know
magrathea
from
any
other
lump
of
cold
rock
dawn's
coming
up
if
you
want
it
ok
ok
muttered
zaphod
let's
at
least
give
our
eyes
a
good
time
computer
hi
there
what
can
i
just
shut
up
and
give
us
a
view
of
the
planet
again
a
dark
featureless
mass
once
more
filled
the
screens
the
planet
rolling
away
beneath
them
they
watched
for
a
moment
in
silence
but
zaphod
was
fidgety
with
excitement
we
are
now
traversing
the
night
side
he
said
in
a
hushed
voice
the
planet
rolled
on
the
surface
of
the
planet
is
now
three
hundred
miles
beneath
us
he
continued
he
was
trying
to
restore
a
sense
of
occasion
to
what
he
felt
should
have
been
a
great
moment
magrathea
he
was
piqued
by
ford's
sceptical
reaction
magrathea
in
a
few
seconds
he
continued
we
should
see
there
the
moment
carried
itself
even
the
most
seasoned
star
tramp
can't
help
but
shiver
at
the
spectacular
drama
of
a
sunrise
seen
from
space
but
a
binary
sunrise
is
one
of
the
marvels
of
the
galaxy
out
of
the
utter
blackness
stabbed
a
sudden
point
of
blinding
light
it
crept
up
by
slight
degrees
and
spread
sideways
in
a
thin
crescent
blade
and
within
seconds
two
suns
were
visible
furnaces
of
light
searing
the
black
edge
of
the
horizon
with
white
fire
fierce
shafts
of
colour
streaked
through
the
thin
atmosphere
beneath
them
the
fires
of
dawn

breathed
zaphod
the
twin
suns
of
soulianis
and
rahm

or
whatever
said
ford
quietly
soulianis
and
rahm
insisted
zaphod
the
suns
blazed
into
the
pitch
of
space
and
a
low
ghostly
music
floated
through
the
bridge
marvin
was
humming
ironically
because
he
hated
humans
so
much
as
ford
gazed
at
the
spectacle
of
light
before
them
excitement
burnt
inside
him
but
only
the
excitement
of
seeing
a
strange
new
planet
it
was
enough
for
him
to
see
it
as
it
was
it
faintly
irritated
him
that
zaphod
had
to
impose
some
ludicrous
fantasy
on
to
the
scene
to
make
it
work
for
him
all
this
magrathea
nonsense
seemed
juvenile
isn't
it
enough
to
see
that
a
garden
is
beautiful
without
having
to
believe
that
there
are
fairies
at
the
bottom
of
it
too
all
this
magrathea
business
seemed
totally
incomprehensible
to
arthur
he
edged
up
to
trillian
and
asked
her
what
was
going
on
i
only
know
what
zaphod's
told
me
she
whispered
apparently
magrathea
is
some
kind
of
legend
from
way
back
which
no
one
seriously
believes
in
bit
like
atlantis
on
earth
except
that
the
legends
say
the
magratheans
used
to
manufacture
planets
arthur
blinked
at
the
screens
and
felt
he
was
missing
something
important
suddenly
he
realized
what
it
was
is
there
any
tea
on
this
spaceship
he
asked
more
of
the
planet
was
unfolding
beneath
them
as
the
heart
of
gold
streaked
along
its
orbital
path
the
suns
now
stood
high
in
the
black
sky
the
pyrotechnics
of
dawn
were
over
and
the
surface
of
the
planet
appeared
bleak
and
forbidding
in
the
common
light
of
day
grey
dusty
and
only
dimly
contoured
it
looked
dead
and
cold
as
a
crypt
from
time
to
time
promising
features
would
appear
on
the
distant
horizon
ravines
maybe
mountains
maybe
even
cities
but
as
they
approached
the
lines
would
soften
and
blur
into
anonymity
and
nothing
would
transpire
the
planet's
surface
was
blurred
by
time
by
the
slow
movement
of
the
thin
stagnant
air
that
had
crept
across
it
for
century
upon
century
clearly
it
was
very
very
old
a
moment
of
doubt
came
to
ford
as
he
watched
the
grey
landscape
move
beneath
them
the
immensity
of
time
worried
him
he
could
feel
it
as
a
presence
he
cleared
his
throat
well
even
supposing
it
is
it
is
said
zaphod
which
it
isn't
continued
ford
what
do
you
want
with
it
anyway
there's
nothing
there
not
on
the
surface
said
zaphod
alright
just
supposing
there's
something
i
take
it
you're
not
here
for
the
sheer
industrial
archaeology
of
it
all
what
are
you
after
one
of
zaphod's
heads
looked
away
the
other
one
looked
round
to
see
what
the
first
was
looking
at
but
it
wasn't
looking
at
anything
very
much
well
said
zaphod
airily
it's
partly
the
curiosity
partly
a
sense
of
adventure
but
mostly
i
think
it's
the
fame
and
the
money
ford
glanced
at
him
sharply
he
got
a
very
strong
impression
that
zaphod
hadn't
the
faintest
idea
why
he
was
there
at
all
you
know
i
don't
like
the
look
of
that
planet
at
all
said
trillian
shivering
ah
take
no
notice
said
zaphod
with
half
the
wealth
of
the
former
galactic
empire
stored
on
it
somewhere
it
can
afford
to
look
frumpy
bullshit
thought
ford
even
supposing
this
was
the
home
of
some
ancient
civilization
now
gone
to
dust
even
supposing
a
number
of
exceedingly
unlikely
things
there
was
no
way
that
vast
treasures
of
wealth
were
going
to
be
stored
there
in
any
form
that
would
still
have
meaning
now
he
shrugged
i
think
it's
just
a
dead
planet
he
said
the
suspense
is
killing
me
said
arthur
testily
stress
and
nervous
tension
are
now
serious
social
problems
in
all
parts
of
the
galaxy
and
it
is
in
order
that
this
situation
should
not
in
any
way
be
exacerbated
that
the
following
facts
will
now
be
revealed
in
advance
the
planet
in
question
is
in
fact
the
legendary
magrathea
the
deadly
missile
attack
shortly
to
be
launched
by
an
ancient
automatic
defence
system
will
result
merely
in
the
breakage
of
three
coffee
cups
and
a
micecage
the
bruising
of
somebody's
upper
arm
and
the
untimely
creation
and
sudden
demise
of
a
bowl
of
petunias
and
an
innocent
sperm
whale
in
order
that
some
sense
of
mystery
should
still
be
preserved
no
revelation
will
yet
be
made
concerning
whose
upper
arm
sustained
the
bruise
this
fact
may
safely
be
made
the
subject
of
suspense
since
it
is
of
no
significance
whatsoever
chapter
after
a
fairly
shaky
start
to
the
day
arthur's
mind
was
beginning
to
reassemble
itself
from
the
shellshocked
fragments
the
previous
day
had
left
him
with
he
had
found
a
nutrimatic
machine
which
had
provided
him
with
a
plastic
cup
filled
with
a
liquid
that
was
almost
but
not
quite
entirely
unlike
tea
the
way
it
functioned
was
very
interesting
when
the
drink
button
was
pressed
it
made
an
instant
but
highly
detailed
examination
of
the
subject's
taste
buds
a
spectroscopic
analysis
of
the
subject's
metabolism
and
then
sent
tiny
experimental
signals
down
the
neural
pathways
to
the
taste
centres
of
the
subject's
brain
to
see
what
was
likely
to
go
down
well
however
no
one
knew
quite
why
it
did
this
because
it
invariably
delivered
a
cupful
of
liquid
that
was
almost
but
not
quite
entirely
unlike
tea
the
nutrimatic
was
designed
and
manufactured
by
the
sirius
cybernetics
corporation
whose
complaints
department
now
covers
all
the
major
land
masses
of
the
first
three
planets
in
the
sirius
tau
star
system
arthur
drank
the
liquid
and
found
it
reviving
he
glanced
up
at
the
screens
again
and
watched
a
few
more
hundred
miles
of
barren
greyness
slide
past
it
suddenly
occurred
to
him
to
ask
a
question
which
had
been
bothering
him
is
it
safe
he
said
magrathea's
been
dead
for
five
million
years
said
zaphod
of
course
it's
safe
even
the
ghosts
will
have
settled
down
and
raised
families
by
now
at
which
point
a
strange
and
inexplicable
sound
thrilled
suddenly
through
the
bridge
a
noise
as
of
a
distant
fanfare
a
hollow
reedy
insubstantial
sound
it
preceded
a
voice
that
was
equally
hollow
reedy
and
insubstantial
the
voice
said
greetings
to
you
someone
from
the
dead
planet
was
talking
to
them
computer
shouted
zaphod
hi
there
what
the
photon
is
it
oh
just
some
fivemillionyearold
tape
that's
being
broadcast
at
us
a
what
a
recording
shush
said
ford
it's
carrying
on
the
voice
was
old
courteous
almost
charming
but
was
underscored
with
quite
unmistakable
menace
this
is
a
recorded
announcement
it
said
as
i'm
afraid
we're
all
out
at
the
moment
the
commercial
council
of
magrathea
thanks
you
for
your
esteemed
visit
a
voice
from
ancient
magrathea
shouted
zaphod
ok
ok
said
ford
but
regrets
continued
the
voice
that
the
entire
planet
is
temporarily
closed
for
business
thank
you
if
you
would
care
to
leave
your
name
and
the
address
of
a
planet
where
you
can
be
contacted
kindly
speak
when
you
hear
the
tone
a
short
buzz
followed
then
silence
they
want
to
get
rid
of
us
said
trillian
nervously
what
do
we
do
it's
just
a
recording
said
zaphod
we
keep
going
got
that
computer
i
got
it
said
the
computer
and
gave
the
ship
an
extra
kick
of
speed
they
waited
after
a
second
or
so
came
the
fanfare
once
again
and
then
the
voice
we
would
like
to
assure
you
that
as
soon
as
our
business
is
resumed
announcements
will
be
made
in
all
fashionable
magazines
and
colour
supplements
when
our
clients
will
once
again
be
able
to
select
from
all
that's
best
in
contemporary
geography
the
menace
in
the
voice
took
on
a
sharper
edge
meanwhile
we
thank
our
clients
for
their
kind
interest
and
would
ask
them
to
leave
now
arthur
looked
round
the
nervous
faces
of
his
companions
well
i
suppose
we'd
better
be
going
then
hadn't
we
he
suggested
shhh
said
zaphod
there's
absolutely
nothing
to
be
worried
about
then
why's
everyone
so
tense
they're
just
interested
shouted
zaphod
computer
start
a
descent
into
the
atmosphere
and
prepare
for
landing
this
time
the
fanfare
was
quite
perfunctory
the
voice
distinctly
cold
it
is
most
gratifying
it
said
that
your
enthusiasm
for
our
planet
continues
unabated
and
so
we
would
like
to
assure
you
that
the
guided
missiles
currently
converging
with
your
ship
are
part
of
a
special
service
we
extend
to
all
of
our
most
enthusiastic
clients
and
the
fully
armed
nuclear
warheads
are
of
course
merely
a
courtesy
detail
we
look
forward
to
your
custom
in
future
lives
thank
you
the
voice
snapped
off
oh
said
trillian
er
said
arthur
well
said
ford
look
said
zaphod
will
you
get
it
into
your
heads
that's
just
a
recorded
message
it's
millions
of
years
old
it
doesn't
apply
to
us
get
it
what
said
trillian
quietly
about
the
missiles
missiles
don't
make
me
laugh
ford
tapped
zaphod
on
the
shoulder
and
pointed
at
the
rear
screen
clear
in
the
distance
behind
them
two
silver
darts
were
climbing
through
the
atmosphere
towards
the
ship
a
quick
change
of
magnification
brought
them
into
close
focus
two
massively
real
rockets
thundering
through
the
sky
the
suddenness
of
it
was
shocking
i
think
they're
going
to
have
a
very
good
try
at
applying
to
us
said
ford
zaphod
stared
at
them
in
astonishment
hey
this
is
terrific
he
said
someone
down
there
is
trying
to
kill
us
terrific
said
arthur
but
don't
you
see
what
this
means
yes
we're
going
to
die
yes
but
apart
from
that
apart
from
that
it
means
we
must
be
on
to
something
how
soon
can
we
get
off
it
second
by
second
the
image
of
the
missiles
on
the
screen
became
larger
they
had
swung
round
now
on
to
a
direct
homing
course
so
that
all
that
could
be
seen
of
them
now
was
the
warheads
head
on
as
a
matter
of
interest
said
trillian
what
are
we
going
to
do
just
keep
cool
said
zaphod
is
that
all
shouted
arthur
no
we're
also
going
to
er
take
evasive
action
said
zaphod
with
a
sudden
access
of
panic
computer
what
evasive
action
can
we
take
er
none
i'm
afraid
guys
said
the
computer
or
something
said
zaphod
er
he
said
there
seems
to
be
something
jamming
my
guidance
system
explained
the
computer
brightly
impact
minus
fortyfive
seconds
please
call
me
eddie
if
it
will
help
you
to
relax
zaphod
tried
to
run
in
several
equally
decisive
directions
simultaneously
right
he
said
er
we've
got
to
get
manual
control
of
this
ship
can
you
fly
her
asked
ford
pleasantly
no
can
you
no
trillian
can
you
no
fine
said
zaphod
relaxing
we'll
do
it
together
i
can't
either
said
arthur
who
felt
it
was
time
he
began
to
assert
himself
i'd
guessed
that
said
zaphod
ok
computer
i
want
full
manual
control
now
you
got
it
said
the
computer
several
large
desk
panels
slid
open
and
banks
of
control
consoles
sprang
up
out
of
them
showering
the
crew
with
bits
of
expanded
polystyrene
packaging
and
balls
of
rolledup
cellophane
these
controls
had
never
been
used
before
zaphod
stared
at
them
wildly
ok
ford
he
said
full
retro
thrust
and
ten
degrees
starboard
or
something
good
luck
guys
chirped
the
computer
impact
minus
thirty
seconds
ford
leapt
to
the
controls
only
a
few
of
them
made
any
immediate
sense
to
him
so
he
pulled
those
the
ship
shook
and
screamed
as
its
guidance
rocked
jets
tried
to
push
it
every
which
way
simultaneously
he
released
half
of
them
and
the
ship
span
round
in
a
tight
arc
and
headed
back
the
way
it
had
come
straight
towards
the
oncoming
missiles
air
cushions
ballooned
out
of
the
walls
in
an
instant
as
everyone
was
thrown
against
them
for
a
few
seconds
the
inertial
forces
held
them
flattened
and
squirming
for
breath
unable
to
move
zaphod
struggled
and
pushed
in
manic
desperation
and
finally
managed
a
savage
kick
at
a
small
lever
that
formed
part
of
the
guidance
system
the
lever
snapped
off
the
ship
twisted
sharply
and
rocketed
upwards
the
crew
were
hurled
violently
back
across
the
cabin
ford's
copy
of
the
hitch
hiker's
guide
to
the
galaxy
smashed
into
another
section
of
the
control
console
with
the
combined
result
that
the
guide
started
to
explain
to
anyone
who
cared
to
listen
about
the
best
ways
of
smuggling
antarean
parakeet
glands
out
of
antares
an
antarean
parakeet
gland
stuck
on
a
small
stick
is
a
revolting
but
much
sought
after
cocktail
delicacy
and
very
large
sums
of
money
are
often
paid
for
them
by
very
rich
idiots
who
want
to
impress
other
very
rich
idiots
and
the
ship
suddenly
dropped
out
of
the
sky
like
a
stone
it
was
of
course
more
or
less
at
this
moment
that
one
of
the
crew
sustained
a
nasty
bruise
to
the
upper
arm
this
should
be
emphasized
because
as
had
already
been
revealed
they
escape
otherwise
completely
unharmed
and
the
deadly
nuclear
missiles
do
not
eventually
hit
the
ship
the
safety
of
the
crew
is
absolutely
assured
impact
minus
twenty
seconds
guys
said
the
computer
then
turn
the
bloody
engines
back
on
bawled
zaphod
ok
sure
thing
guys
said
the
computer
with
a
subtle
roar
the
engines
cut
back
in
the
ship
smoothly
flattened
out
of
its
dive
and
headed
back
towards
the
missiles
again
the
computer
started
to
sing
when
you
walk
through
the
storm
it
whined
nasally
hold
your
head
up
high
zaphod
screamed
at
it
to
shut
up
but
his
voice
was
lost
in
the
din
of
what
they
quite
naturally
assumed
was
approaching
destruction
and
don't
be
afraid
of
the
dark
eddie
wailed
the
ship
in
flattening
out
had
in
fact
flattened
out
upside
down
and
lying
on
the
ceiling
as
they
were
it
was
now
totally
impossible
for
any
of
the
crew
to
reach
the
guidance
systems
at
the
end
of
the
storm
crooned
eddie
the
two
missiles
loomed
massively
on
the
screens
as
they
thundered
towards
the
ship
is
a
golden
sky
but
by
an
extraordinarily
lucky
chance
they
had
not
yet
fully
corrected
their
flight
paths
to
that
of
the
erratically
weaving
ship
and
they
passed
right
under
it
and
the
sweet
silver
songs
of
the
lark
revised
impact
time
fifteen
seconds
fellas
walk
on
through
the
wind
the
missiles
banked
round
in
a
screeching
arc
and
plunged
back
into
pursuit
this
is
it
said
arthur
watching
them
we
are
now
quite
definitely
going
to
die
aren't
we
i
wish
you'd
stop
saying
that
shouted
ford
well
we
are
aren't
we
yes
walk
on
through
the
rain
sang
eddie
a
thought
struck
arthur
he
struggled
to
his
feet
why
doesn't
anyone
turn
on
this
improbability
drive
thing
he
said
we
could
probably
reach
that
what
are
you
crazy
said
zaphod
without
proper
programming
anything
could
happen
does
that
matter
at
this
stage
shouted
arthur
though
your
dreams
be
tossed
and
blown
sand
eddie
arthur
scrambled
up
on
to
one
end
of
the
excitingly
chunky
pieces
of
moulded
contouring
where
the
curve
of
the
wall
met
the
ceiling
walk
on
walk
on
with
hope
in
your
heart
does
anyone
know
why
arthur
can't
turn
on
the
improbability
drive
shouted
trillian
and
you'll
never
walk
alone
impact
minus
five
seconds
it's
been
great
knowing
you
guys
god
bless
you'll
ne
ver
walk
alone
i
said
yelled
trillian
does
anyone
know
the
next
thing
that
happened
was
a
midmangling
explosion
of
noise
and
light
chapter
and
the
next
thing
that
happened
after
that
was
that
the
heart
of
gold
continued
on
its
way
perfectly
normally
with
a
rather
fetchingly
redesigned
interior
it
was
somewhat
larger
and
done
out
in
delicate
pastel
shades
of
green
and
blue
in
the
centre
a
spiral
staircase
leading
nowhere
in
particular
stood
in
a
spray
of
ferns
and
yellow
flowers
and
next
to
it
a
stone
sundial
pedestal
housed
the
main
computer
terminal
cunningly
deployed
lighting
and
mirrors
created
the
illusion
of
standing
in
a
conservatory
overlooking
a
wide
stretch
of
exquisitely
manicured
garden
around
the
periphery
of
the
conservatory
area
stood
marbletopped
tables
on
intricately
beautiful
wroughtiron
legs
as
you
gazed
into
the
polished
surface
of
the
marble
the
vague
forms
of
instruments
became
visible
and
as
you
touched
them
the
instruments
materialized
instantly
under
your
hands
looked
at
from
the
correct
angles
the
mirrors
appeared
to
reflect
all
the
required
data
readouts
though
it
was
far
from
clear
where
they
were
reflected
from
it
was
in
fact
sensationally
beautiful
relaxing
in
a
wickerwork
sun
chair
zaphod
beeblebrox
said
what
the
hell
happened
well
i
was
just
saying
said
arthur
lounging
by
a
small
fish
pool
there's
this
improbability
drive
switch
over
here
he
waved
at
where
it
had
been
there
was
a
potted
plant
there
now
but
where
are
we
said
ford
who
was
sitting
on
the
spiral
staircase
a
nicely
chilled
pan
galactic
gargle
blaster
in
his
hand
exactly
where
we
were
i
think
said
trillian
as
all
about
them
the
mirrors
showed
them
an
image
of
the
blighted
landscape
of
magrathea
which
still
scooted
along
beneath
them
zaphod
leapt
out
of
his
seat
then
what's
happened
to
the
missiles
he
said
a
new
and
astounding
image
appeared
in
the
mirrors
they
would
appear
said
ford
doubtfully
to
have
turned
into
a
bowl
of
petunias
and
a
very
surprised
looking
whale
at
an
improbability
factor
cut
in
eddie
who
hadn't
changed
a
bit
of
eight
million
seven
hundred
and
sixtyseven
thousand
one
hundred
and
twentyeight
to
one
against
zaphod
stared
at
arthur
did
you
think
of
that
earthman
he
demanded
well
said
arthur
all
i
did
was
that's
very
good
thinking
you
know
turn
on
the
improbability
drive
for
a
second
without
first
activating
the
proofing
screens
hey
kid
you
just
saved
our
lives
you
know
that
oh
said
arthur
well
it
was
nothing
really
was
it
said
zaphod
oh
well
forget
it
then
ok
computer
take
us
in
to
land
but
i
said
forget
it
another
thing
that
got
forgotten
was
the
fact
that
against
all
probability
a
sperm
whale
had
suddenly
been
called
into
existence
several
miles
above
the
surface
of
an
alien
planet
and
since
this
is
not
a
naturally
tenable
position
for
a
whale
this
poor
innocent
creature
had
very
little
time
to
come
to
terms
with
its
identity
as
a
whale
before
it
then
had
to
come
to
terms
with
not
being
a
whale
any
more
this
is
a
complete
record
of
its
thoughts
from
the
moment
it
began
its
life
till
the
moment
it
ended
it
ah

what's
happening
it
thought
er
excuse
me
who
am
i
hello
why
am
i
here
what's
my
purpose
in
life
what
do
i
mean
by
who
am
i
calm
down
get
a
grip
now
oh
this
is
an
interesting
sensation
what
is
it
it's
a
sort
of
yawning
tingling
sensation
in
my
my
well
i
suppose
i'd
better
start
finding
names
for
things
if
i
want
to
make
any
headway
in
what
for
the
sake
of
what
i
shall
call
an
argument
i
shall
call
the
world
so
let's
call
it
my
stomach
good
ooooh
it's
getting
quite
strong
and
hey
what's
about
this
whistling
roaring
sound
going
past
what
i'm
suddenly
going
to
call
my
head
perhaps
i
can
call
that
wind
is
that
a
good
name
it'll
do
perhaps
i
can
find
a
better
name
for
it
later
when
i've
found
out
what
it's
for
it
must
be
something
very
important
because
there
certainly
seems
to
be
a
hell
of
a
lot
of
it
hey
what's
this
thing
this
let's
call
it
a
tail
yeah
tail
hey
i
can
can
really
thrash
it
about
pretty
good
can't
i
wow
wow
that
feels
great
doesn't
seem
to
achieve
very
much
but
i'll
probably
find
out
what
it's
for
later
on
now
have
i
built
up
any
coherent
picture
of
things
yet
no
never
mind
hey
this
is
really
exciting
so
much
to
find
out
about
so
much
to
look
forward
to
i'm
quite
dizzy
with
anticipation
or
is
it
the
wind
there
really
is
a
lot
of
that
now
isn't
it
and
wow
hey
what's
this
thing
suddenly
coming
towards
me
very
fast
very
very
fast
so
big
and
flat
and
round
it
needs
a
big
wide
sounding
name
like
ow
ound
round
ground
that's
it
that's
a
good
name
ground
i
wonder
if
it
will
be
friends
with
me
and
the
rest
after
a
sudden
wet
thud
was
silence
curiously
enough
the
only
thing
that
went
through
the
mind
of
the
bowl
of
petunias
as
it
fell
was
oh
no
not
again
many
people
have
speculated
that
if
we
knew
exactly
why
the
bowl
of
petunias
had
thought
that
we
would
know
a
lot
more
about
the
nature
of
the
universe
than
we
do
now
chapter
are
we
taking
this
robot
with
us
said
ford
looking
with
distaste
at
marvin
who
was
standing
in
an
awkward
hunched
posture
in
the
corner
under
a
small
palm
tree
zaphod
glanced
away
from
the
mirror
screens
which
presented
a
panoramic
view
of
the
blighted
landscape
on
which
the
heart
of
gold
had
now
landed
oh
the
paranoid
android
he
said
yeah
we'll
take
him
but
what
are
supposed
to
do
with
a
manically
depressed
robot
you
think
you've
got
problems
said
marvin
as
if
he
was
addressing
a
newly
occupied
coffin
what
are
you
supposed
to
do
if
you
are
a
manically
depressed
robot
no
don't
bother
to
answer
that
i'm
fifty
thousand
times
more
intelligent
than
you
and
even
i
don't
know
the
answer
it
gives
me
a
headache
just
trying
to
think
down
to
your
level
trillian
burst
in
through
the
door
from
her
cabin
my
white
mice
have
escaped
she
said
an
expression
of
deep
worry
and
concern
failed
to
cross
either
of
zaphod's
faces
nuts
to
your
white
mice
he
said
trillian
glared
an
upset
glare
at
him
and
disappeared
again
it
is
possible
that
her
remark
would
have
commanded
greater
attention
had
it
been
generally
realized
that
human
beings
were
only
the
third
most
intelligent
life
form
present
on
the
planet
earth
instead
of
as
was
generally
thought
by
most
independent
observers
the
second
good
afternoon
boys
the
voice
was
oddly
familiar
but
oddly
different
it
had
a
matriarchal
twang
it
announced
itself
to
the
crew
as
they
arrived
at
the
airlock
hatchway
that
would
let
them
out
on
the
planet
surface
they
looked
at
each
other
in
puzzlement
it's
the
computer
explained
zaphod
i
discovered
it
had
an
emergency
backup
personality
that
i
thought
might
work
out
better
now
this
is
going
to
be
your
first
day
out
on
a
strange
new
planet
continued
eddie's
new
voice
so
i
want
you
all
wrapped
up
snug
and
warm
and
no
playing
with
any
naughty
bugeyed
monsters
zaphod
tapped
impatiently
on
the
hatch
i'm
sorry
he
said
i
think
we
might
be
better
off
with
a
slide
rule
right
snapped
the
computer
who
said
that
will
you
open
the
exit
hatch
please
computer
said
zaphod
trying
not
to
get
angry
not
until
whoever
said
that
owns
up
urged
the
computer
stamping
a
few
synapses
closed
oh
god
muttered
ford
slumped
against
a
bulkhead
and
started
to
count
to
ten
he
was
desperately
worried
that
one
day
sentinent
life
forms
would
forget
how
to
do
this
only
by
counting
could
humans
demonstrate
their
independence
of
computers
come
on
said
eddie
sternly
computer
began
zaphod
i'm
waiting
interrupted
eddie
i
can
wait
all
day
if
necessary
computer
said
zaphod
again
who
had
been
trying
to
think
of
some
subtle
piece
of
reasoning
to
put
the
computer
down
with
and
had
decided
not
to
bother
competing
with
it
on
its
own
ground
if
you
don't
open
that
exit
hatch
this
moment
i
shall
zap
straight
off
to
your
major
data
banks
and
reprogram
you
with
a
very
large
axe
got
that
eddie
shocked
paused
and
considered
this
ford
carried
on
counting
quietly
this
is
about
the
most
aggressive
thing
you
can
do
to
a
computer
the
equivalent
of
going
up
to
a
human
being
and
saying
blood
blood
blood
blood
finally
eddie
said
quietly
i
can
see
this
relationship
is
something
we're
all
going
to
have
to
work
at
and
the
hatchway
opened
an
icy
wind
ripped
into
them
they
hugged
themselves
warmly
and
stepped
down
the
ramp
on
to
the
barren
dust
of
magrathea
it'll
all
end
in
tears
i
know
it
shouted
eddie
after
them
and
closed
the
hatchway
again
a
few
minutes
later
he
opened
and
closed
the
hatchway
again
in
response
to
a
command
that
caught
him
entirely
by
surprise
chapter
five
figures
wandered
slowly
over
the
blighted
land
bits
of
it
were
dullish
grey
bits
of
it
dullish
brown
the
rest
of
it
rather
less
interesting
to
look
at
it
was
like
a
driedout
marsh
now
barren
of
all
vegetation
and
covered
with
a
layer
of
dust
about
an
inch
thick
it
was
very
cold
zaphod
was
clearly
rather
depressed
about
it
he
stalked
off
by
himself
and
was
soon
lost
to
sight
behind
a
slight
rise
in
the
ground
the
wind
stung
arthur's
eyes
and
ears
and
the
stale
thin
air
clasped
his
throat
however
the
thing
stung
most
was
his
mind
it's
fantastic
he
said
and
his
own
voice
rattled
his
ears
sound
carried
badly
in
this
thin
atmosphere
desolate
hole
if
you
ask
me
said
ford
i
could
have
more
fun
in
a
cat
litter
he
felt
a
mounting
irritation
of
all
the
planets
in
all
the
star
systems
of
all
the
galaxy
didn't
he
just
have
to
turn
up
at
a
dump
like
this
after
fifteen
years
of
being
a
castaway
not
even
a
hot
dog
stand
in
evidence
he
stooped
down
and
picked
up
a
cold
clot
of
earth
but
there
was
nothing
underneath
it
worth
crossing
thousands
of
light
years
to
look
at
no
insisted
arthur
don't
you
understand
this
is
the
first
time
i've
actually
stood
on
the
surface
of
another
planet
a
whole
alien
world
pity
it's
such
a
dump
though
trillian
hugged
herself
shivered
and
frowned
she
could
have
sworn
she
saw
a
slight
and
unexpected
movement
out
of
the
corner
of
her
eye
but
when
she
glanced
in
that
direction
all
she
could
see
was
the
ship
still
and
silent
a
hundred
yards
or
so
behind
them
she
was
relieved
when
a
second
or
so
later
they
caught
sight
of
zaphod
standing
on
top
of
the
ridge
of
ground
and
waving
to
them
to
come
and
join
him
he
seemed
to
be
excited
but
they
couldn't
clearly
hear
what
he
was
saying
because
of
the
thinnish
atmosphere
and
the
wind
as
they
approached
the
ridge
of
higher
ground
they
became
aware
that
it
seemed
to
be
circular
a
crater
about
a
hundred
and
fifty
yards
wide
round
the
outside
of
the
crater
the
sloping
ground
was
spattered
with
black
and
red
lumps
they
stopped
and
looked
at
a
piece
it
was
wet
it
was
rubbery
with
horror
they
suddenly
realized
that
it
was
fresh
whalemeat
at
the
top
of
the
crater's
lip
they
met
zaphod
look
he
said
pointing
into
the
crater
in
the
centre
lay
the
exploded
carcass
of
a
lonely
sperm
whale
that
hadn't
lived
long
enough
to
be
disappointed
with
its
lot
the
silence
was
only
disturbed
by
the
slight
involuntary
spasms
of
trillian's
throat
i
suppose
there's
no
point
in
trying
to
bury
it
murmured
arthur
and
then
wished
he
hadn't
come
said
zaphod
and
started
back
down
into
the
crater
what
down
there
said
trillian
with
severe
distaste
yeah
said
zaphod
come
on
i've
got
something
to
show
you
we
can
see
it
said
trillian
not
that
said
zaphod
something
else
come
on
they
all
hesitated
come
on
insisted
zaphod
i've
found
a
way
in
in
said
arthur
in
horror
into
the
interior
of
the
planet
an
underground
passage
the
force
of
the
whale's
impact
cracked
it
open
and
that's
where
we
have
to
go
where
no
man
has
trod
these
five
million
years
into
the
very
depths
of
time
itself
marvin
started
his
ironical
humming
again
zaphod
hit
him
and
he
shut
up
with
little
shudders
of
disgust
they
all
followed
zaphod
down
the
incline
into
the
crater
trying
very
hard
not
to
look
at
its
unfortunate
creator
life
said
marvin
dolefully
loathe
it
or
ignore
it
you
can't
like
it
the
ground
had
caved
in
where
the
whale
had
hit
it
revealing
a
network
of
galleries
and
passages
now
largely
obstructed
by
collapsed
rubble
and
entrails
zaphod
had
made
a
start
clearing
a
way
into
one
of
them
but
marvin
was
able
to
do
it
rather
faster
dank
air
wafted
out
of
its
dark
recesses
and
as
zaphod
shone
a
torch
into
it
little
was
visible
in
the
dusty
gloom
according
to
the
legends
he
said
the
magratheans
lived
most
of
their
lives
underground
why's
that
said
arthur
did
the
surface
become
too
polluted
or
overpopulated
no
i
don't
think
so
said
zaphod
i
think
they
just
didn't
like
it
very
much
are
you
sure
you
know
what
you're
doing
said
trillian
peering
nervously
into
the
darkness
we've
been
attacked
once
already
you
know
look
kid
i
promise
you
the
live
population
of
this
planet
is
nil
plus
the
four
of
us
so
come
on
let's
get
on
in
there
er
hey
earthman
arthur
said
arthur
yeah
could
you
just
sort
of
keep
this
robot
with
you
and
guard
this
end
of
the
passageway
ok
guard
said
arthur
what
from
you
just
said
there's
no
one
here
yeah
well
just
for
safety
ok
said
zaphod
whose
yours
or
mine
good
lad
ok
here
we
go
zaphod
scrambled
down
into
the
passage
followed
by
trillian
and
ford
well
i
hope
you
all
have
a
really
miserable
time
complained
arthur
don't
worry
marvin
assured
him
they
will
in
a
few
seconds
they
had
disappeared
from
view
arthur
stamped
around
in
a
huff
and
then
decided
that
a
whale's
graveyard
is
not
on
the
whole
a
good
place
to
stamp
around
in
marvin
eyed
him
balefully
for
a
moment
and
then
turned
himself
off
zaphod
marched
quickly
down
the
passageway
nervous
as
hell
but
trying
to
hide
it
by
striding
purposefully
he
flung
the
torch
beam
around
the
walls
were
covered
in
dark
tiles
and
were
cold
to
the
touch
the
air
thick
with
decay
there
what
did
i
tell
you
he
said
an
inhabited
planet
magrathea
and
he
strode
on
through
the
dirt
and
debris
that
littered
the
tile
floor
trillian
was
reminded
unavoidably
of
the
london
underground
though
it
was
less
thoroughly
squalid
at
intervals
along
the
walls
the
tiles
gave
way
to
large
mosaics
simple
angular
patterns
in
bright
colours
trillian
stopped
and
studied
one
of
them
but
could
not
interpret
any
sense
in
them
she
called
to
zaphod
hey
have
you
any
idea
what
these
strange
symbols
are
i
think
they're
just
strange
symbols
of
some
kind
said
zaphod
hardly
glancing
back
trillian
shrugged
and
hurried
after
him
from
time
to
time
a
doorway
led
either
to
the
left
or
right
into
smallish
chambers
which
ford
discovered
to
be
full
of
derelict
computer
equipment
he
dragged
zaphod
into
one
to
have
a
look
trillian
followed
look
said
ford
you
reckon
this
is
magrathea
yeah
said
zaphod
and
we
heard
the
voice
right
ok
so
i've
bought
the
fact
that
it's
magrathea
for
the
moment
what
you
have
so
far
said
nothing
about
is
how
in
the
galaxy
you
found
it
you
didn't
just
look
it
up
in
a
star
atlas
that's
for
sure
research
government
archives
detective
work
few
lucky
guesses
easy
and
then
you
stole
the
heart
of
gold
to
come
and
look
for
it
with
i
stole
it
to
look
for
a
lot
of
things
a
lot
of
things
said
ford
in
surprise
like
what
i
don't
know
what
i
don't
know
what
i'm
looking
for
why
not
because
because
i
think
it
might
be
because
if
i
knew
i
wouldn't
be
able
to
look
for
them
what
are
you
crazy
it's
a
possibility
i
haven't
ruled
out
yet
said
zaphod
quietly
i
only
know
as
much
about
myself
as
my
mind
can
work
out
under
its
current
conditions
and
its
current
conditions
are
not
good
for
a
long
time
nobody
said
anything
as
ford
gazed
at
zaphod
with
a
mind
suddenly
full
of
worry
listen
old
friend
if
you
want
to
started
ford
eventually
no
wait
i'll
tell
you
something
said
zaphod
i
freewheel
a
lot
i
get
an
idea
to
do
something
and
hey
why
not
i
do
it
i
reckon
i'll
become
president
of
the
galaxy
and
it
just
happens
it's
easy
i
decide
to
steal
this
ship
i
decide
to
look
for
magrathea
and
it
all
just
happens
yeah
i
work
out
how
it
can
best
be
done
right
but
it
always
works
out
it's
like
having
a
galacticredit
card
which
keeps
on
working
though
you
never
send
off
the
cheques
and
then
whenever
i
stop
and
think
why
did
i
want
to
do
something
how
did
i
work
out
how
to
do
it
i
get
a
very
strong
desire
just
to
stop
thinking
about
it
like
i
have
now
it's
a
big
effort
to
talk
about
it
zaphod
paused
for
a
while
for
a
while
there
was
silence
then
he
frowned
and
said
last
night
i
was
worrying
about
this
again
about
the
fact
that
part
of
my
mind
just
didn't
seem
to
work
properly
then
it
occurred
to
me
that
the
way
it
seemed
was
that
someone
else
was
using
my
mind
to
have
good
ideas
with
without
telling
me
about
it
i
put
the
two
ideas
together
and
decided
that
maybe
that
somebody
had
locked
off
part
of
my
mind
for
that
purpose
which
was
why
i
couldn't
use
it
i
wondered
if
there
was
a
way
i
could
check
i
went
to
the
ship's
medical
bay
and
plugged
myself
into
the
encephelographic
screen
i
went
through
every
major
screening
test
on
both
my
heads
all
the
tests
i
had
to
go
through
under
government
medical
officers
before
my
nomination
for
presidency
could
be
properly
ratified
they
showed
up
nothing
nothing
unexpected
at
least
they
showed
that
i
was
clever
imaginative
irresponsible
untrustworthy
extrovert
nothing
you
couldn't
have
guessed
and
no
other
anomalies
so
i
started
inventing
further
tests
completely
at
random
nothing
then
i
tried
superimposing
the
results
from
one
head
on
top
of
the
results
from
the
other
head
still
nothing
finally
i
got
silly
because
i'd
given
it
all
up
as
nothing
more
than
an
attack
of
paranoia
last
thing
i
did
before
i
packed
it
in
was
take
the
superimposed
picture
and
look
at
it
through
a
green
filter
you
remember
i
was
always
superstitious
about
the
color
green
when
i
was
a
kid
i
always
wanted
to
be
a
pilot
on
one
of
the
trading
scouts
ford
nodded
and
there
it
was
said
zaphod
clear
as
day
a
whole
section
in
the
middle
of
both
brains
that
related
only
to
each
other
and
not
to
anything
else
around
them
some
bastard
had
cauterized
all
the
synapses
and
electronically
traumatised
those
two
lumps
of
cerebellum
ford
stared
at
him
aghast
trillian
had
turned
white
somebody
did
that
to
you
whispered
ford
yeah
but
have
you
any
idea
who
or
why
why
i
can
only
guess
but
i
do
know
who
the
bastard
was
you
know
how
do
you
know
because
they
left
their
initials
burnt
into
the
cauterized
synapses
they
left
them
there
for
me
to
see
ford
stared
at
him
in
horror
and
felt
his
skin
begin
to
crawl
initials
burnt
into
your
brain
yeah
well
what
were
they
for
god's
sake
zaphod
looked
at
him
in
silence
again
for
a
moment
then
he
looked
away
zb
he
said
at
that
moment
a
steel
shutter
slammed
down
behind
them
and
gas
started
to
pour
into
the
chamber
i'll
tell
you
about
it
later
choked
zaphod
as
all
three
passed
out
chapter
on
the
surface
of
magrathea
arthur
wandered
about
moodily
ford
had
thoughtfully
left
him
his
copy
of
the
hitch
hiker's
guide
to
the
galaxy
to
while
away
the
time
with
he
pushed
a
few
buttons
at
random
the
hitch
hiker's
guide
to
the
galaxy
is
a
very
unevenly
edited
book
and
contains
many
passages
that
simply
seemed
to
its
editors
like
a
good
idea
at
the
time
one
of
these
the
one
arthur
now
came
across
supposedly
relates
the
experiences
of
one
veet
voojagig
a
quiet
young
student
at
the
university
of
maximegalon
who
pursued
a
brilliant
academic
career
studying
ancient
philology
transformational
ethics
and
the
wave
harmonic
theory
of
historical
perception
and
then
after
a
night
of
drinking
pan
galactic
gargle
blasters
with
zaphod
beeblebrox
became
increasingly
obsessed
with
the
problem
of
what
had
happened
to
all
the
biros
he'd
bought
over
the
past
few
years
there
followed
a
long
period
of
painstaking
research
during
which
he
visited
all
the
major
centres
of
biro
loss
throughout
the
galaxy
and
eventually
came
up
with
a
quaint
little
theory
which
quite
caught
the
public
imagination
at
the
time
somewhere
in
the
cosmos
he
said
along
with
all
the
planets
inhabited
by
humanoids
reptiloids
fishoids
walking
treeoids
and
superintelligent
shades
of
the
colour
blue
there
was
also
a
planet
entirely
given
over
to
biro
life
forms
and
it
was
to
this
planet
that
unattended
biros
would
make
their
way
slipping
away
quietly
through
wormholes
in
space
to
a
world
where
they
knew
they
could
enjoy
a
uniquely
biroid
lifestyle
responding
to
highly
birooriented
stimuli
and
generally
leading
the
biro
equivalent
of
the
good
life
and
as
theories
go
this
was
all
very
fine
and
pleasant
until
veet
voojagig
suddenly
claimed
to
have
found
this
planet
and
to
have
worked
there
for
a
while
driving
a
limousine
for
a
family
of
cheap
green
retractables
whereupon
he
was
taken
away
locked
up
wrote
a
book
and
was
finally
sent
into
tax
exile
which
is
the
usual
fate
reserved
for
those
who
are
determined
to
make
a
fool
of
themselves
in
public
when
one
day
an
expedition
was
sent
to
the
spatial
coordinates
that
voojagig
had
claimed
for
this
planet
they
discovered
only
a
small
asteroid
inhabited
by
a
solitary
old
man
who
claimed
repeatedly
that
nothing
was
true
though
he
was
later
discovered
to
be
lying
there
did
however
remain
the
question
of
both
the
mysterious
altairan
dollars
paid
yearly
into
his
brantisvogan
bank
account
and
of
course
zaphod
beeblebrox's
highly
profitable
secondhand
biro
business
arthur
read
this
and
put
the
book
down
the
robot
still
sat
there
completely
inert
arthur
got
up
and
walked
to
the
top
of
the
crater
he
walked
around
the
crater
he
watched
two
suns
set
magnificently
over
magrathea
he
went
back
down
into
the
crater
he
woke
the
robot
up
because
even
a
manically
depressed
robot
is
better
to
talk
to
than
nobody
night's
falling
he
said
look
robot
the
stars
are
coming
out
from
the
heart
of
a
dark
nebula
it
is
possible
to
see
very
few
stars
and
only
very
faintly
but
they
were
there
to
be
seen
the
robot
obediently
looked
at
them
then
looked
back
i
know
he
said
wretched
isn't
it
but
that
sunset
i've
never
seen
anything
like
it
in
my
wildest
dreams
the
two
suns
it
was
like
mountains
of
fire
boiling
into
space
i've
seen
it
said
marvin
it's
rubbish
we
only
ever
had
the
one
sun
at
home
persevered
arthur
i
came
from
a
planet
called
earth
you
know
i
know
said
marvin
you
keep
going
on
about
it
it
sounds
awful
ah
no
it
was
a
beautiful
place
did
it
have
oceans
oh
yes
said
arthur
with
a
sigh
great
wide
rolling
blue
oceans
can't
bear
oceans
said
marvin
tell
me
inquired
arthur
do
you
get
on
well
with
other
robots
hate
them
said
marvin
where
are
you
going
arthur
couldn't
bear
any
more
he
had
got
up
again
i
think
i'll
just
take
another
walk
he
said
don't
blame
you
said
marvin
and
counted
five
hundred
and
ninetyseven
thousand
million
sheep
before
falling
asleep
again
a
second
later
arthur
slapped
his
arms
about
himself
to
try
and
get
his
circulation
a
little
more
enthusiastic
about
its
job
he
trudged
back
up
the
wall
of
the
crater
because
the
atmosphere
was
so
thin
and
because
there
was
no
moon
nightfall
was
very
rapid
and
it
was
by
now
very
dark
because
of
this
arthur
practically
walked
into
the
old
man
before
he
noticed
him
chapter
he
was
standing
with
his
back
to
arthur
watching
the
very
last
glimmers
of
light
sink
into
blackness
behind
the
horizon
he
was
tallish
elderly
and
dressed
in
a
single
long
grey
robe
when
he
turned
his
face
was
thin
and
distinguished
careworn
but
not
unkind
the
sort
of
face
you
would
happily
bank
with
but
he
didn't
turn
yet
not
even
to
react
to
arthur's
yelp
of
surprise
eventually
the
last
rays
of
the
sun
had
vanished
completely
and
he
turned
his
face
was
still
illuminated
from
somewhere
and
when
arthur
looked
for
the
source
of
the
light
he
saw
that
a
few
yards
away
stood
a
small
craft
of
some
kind
a
small
hovercraft
arthur
guessed
it
shed
a
dim
pool
of
light
around
it
the
man
looked
at
arthur
sadly
it
seemed
you
choose
a
cold
night
to
visit
our
dead
planet
he
said
who
who
are
you
stammered
arthur
the
man
looked
away
again
a
kind
of
sadness
seemed
to
cross
his
face
my
name
is
not
important
he
said
he
seemed
to
have
something
on
his
mind
conversation
was
clearly
something
he
felt
he
didn't
have
to
rush
at
arthur
felt
awkward
i
er
you
startled
me
he
said
lamely
the
man
looked
round
to
him
again
and
slightly
raised
his
eyebrows
hmmmm
he
said
i
said
you
startled
me
do
not
be
alarmed
i
will
not
harm
you
arthur
frowned
at
him
but
you
shot
at
us
there
were
missiles
he
said
the
man
chuckled
slightly
an
automatic
system
he
said
and
gave
a
small
sigh
ancient
computers
ranged
in
the
bowels
of
the
planet
tick
away
the
dark
millennia
and
the
ages
hang
heavy
on
their
dusty
data
banks
i
think
they
take
the
occasional
pot
shot
to
relieve
the
monotony
he
looked
gravely
at
arthur
and
said
i'm
a
great
fan
of
science
you
know
oh
er
really
said
arthur
who
was
beginning
to
find
the
man's
curious
kindly
manner
disconcerting
oh
yes
said
the
old
man
and
simply
stopped
talking
again
ah
said
arthur
er
he
had
an
odd
felling
of
being
like
a
man
in
the
act
of
adultery
who
is
surprised
when
the
woman's
husband
wanders
into
the
room
changes
his
trousers
passes
a
few
idle
remarks
about
the
weather
and
leaves
again
you
seem
ill
at
ease
said
the
old
man
with
polite
concern
er
no
well
yes
actually
you
see
we
weren't
really
expecting
to
find
anybody
about
in
fact
i
sort
of
gathered
that
you
were
all
dead
or
something
dead
said
the
old
man
good
gracious
no
we
have
but
slept
slept
said
arthur
incredulously
yes
through
the
economic
recession
you
see
said
the
old
man
apparently
unconcerned
about
whether
arthur
understood
a
word
he
was
talking
about
or
not
er
economic
recession
well
you
see
five
million
years
ago
the
galactic
economy
collapsed
and
seeing
that
custommade
planets
are
something
of
a
luxury
commodity
you
see
he
paused
and
looked
at
arthur
you
know
we
built
planets
do
you
he
asked
solemnly
well
yes
said
arthur
i'd
sort
of
gathered
fascinating
trade
said
the
old
man
and
a
wistful
look
came
into
his
eyes
doing
the
coastlines
was
always
my
favourite
used
to
have
endless
fun
doing
the
little
bits
in
fjords
so
anyway
he
said
trying
to
find
his
thread
again
the
recession
came
and
we
decided
it
would
save
us
a
lot
of
bother
if
we
just
slept
through
it
so
we
programmed
the
computers
to
revive
us
when
it
was
all
over
the
man
stifled
a
very
slight
yawn
and
continued
the
computers
were
index
linked
to
the
galactic
stock
market
prices
you
see
so
that
we'd
all
be
revived
when
everybody
else
had
rebuilt
the
economy
enough
to
afford
our
rather
expensive
services
arthur
a
regular
guardian
reader
was
deeply
shocked
at
this
that's
a
pretty
unpleasant
way
to
behave
isn't
it
is
it
asked
the
old
man
mildly
i'm
sorry
i'm
a
bit
out
of
touch
he
pointed
down
into
the
crater
is
that
robot
yours
he
said
no
came
a
thin
metallic
voice
from
the
crater
i'm
mine
if
you'd
call
it
a
robot
muttered
arthur
it's
more
a
sort
of
electronic
sulking
machine
bring
it
said
the
old
man
arthur
was
quite
surprised
to
hear
a
note
of
decision
suddenly
present
in
the
old
man's
voice
he
called
to
marvin
who
crawled
up
the
slope
making
a
big
show
of
being
lame
which
he
wasn't
on
second
thoughts
said
the
old
man
leave
it
here
you
must
come
with
me
great
things
are
afoot
he
turned
towards
his
craft
which
though
no
apparent
signal
had
been
given
now
drifted
quietly
towards
them
through
the
dark
arthur
looked
down
at
marvin
who
now
made
an
equally
big
show
of
turning
round
laboriously
and
trudging
off
down
into
the
crater
again
muttering
sour
nothings
to
himself
come
called
the
old
man
come
now
or
you
will
be
late
late
said
arthur
what
for
what
is
your
name
human
dent
arthur
dent
said
arthur
late
as
in
the
late
dentarthurdent
said
the
old
man
sternly
it's
a
sort
of
threat
you
see
another
wistful
look
came
into
his
tired
old
eyes
i've
never
been
very
good
at
them
myself
but
i'm
told
they
can
be
very
effective
arthur
blinked
at
him
what
an
extraordinary
person
he
muttered
to
himself
i
beg
your
pardon
said
the
old
man
oh
nothing
i'm
sorry
said
arthur
in
embarrassment
alright
where
do
we
go
in
my
aircar
said
the
old
man
motioning
arthur
to
get
into
the
craft
which
had
settled
silently
next
to
them
we
are
going
deep
into
the
bowels
of
the
planet
where
even
now
our
race
is
being
revived
from
its
fivemillionyear
slumber
magrathea
awakes
arthur
shivered
involuntarily
as
he
seated
himself
next
to
the
old
man
the
strangeness
of
it
the
silent
bobbing
movement
of
the
craft
as
it
soared
into
the
night
sky
quite
unsettled
him
he
looked
at
the
old
man
his
face
illuminated
by
the
dull
glow
of
tiny
lights
on
the
instrument
panel
excuse
me
he
said
to
him
what
is
your
name
by
the
way
my
name
said
the
old
man
and
the
same
distant
sadness
came
into
his
face
again
he
paused
my
name
he
said
is
slartibartfast
arthur
practically
choked
i
beg
your
pardon
he
spluttered
slartibartfast
repeated
the
old
man
quietly
slartibartfast
the
old
man
looked
at
him
gravely
i
said
it
wasn't
important
he
said
the
aircar
sailed
through
the
night
chapter
it
is
an
important
and
popular
fact
that
things
are
not
always
what
they
seem
for
instance
on
the
planet
earth
man
had
always
assumed
that
he
was
more
intelligent
than
dolphins
because
he
had
achieved
so
much
the
wheel
new
york
wars
and
so
on
whilst
all
the
dolphins
had
ever
done
was
muck
about
in
the
water
having
a
good
time
but
conversely
the
dolphins
had
always
believed
that
they
were
far
more
intelligent
than
man
for
precisely
the
same
reasons
curiously
enough
the
dolphins
had
long
known
of
the
impending
destruction
of
the
planet
earth
and
had
made
many
attempts
to
alert
mankind
of
the
danger
but
most
of
their
communications
were
misinterpreted
as
amusing
attempts
to
punch
footballs
or
whistle
for
tidbits
so
they
eventually
gave
up
and
left
the
earth
by
their
own
means
shortly
before
the
vogons
arrived
the
last
ever
dolphin
message
was
misinterpreted
as
a
surprisingly
sophisticated
attempt
to
do
a
doublebackwards
somersault
through
a
hoop
whilst
whistling
the
star
sprangled
banner
but
in
fact
the
message
was
this
so
long
and
thanks
for
all
the
fish
in
fact
there
was
only
one
species
on
the
planet
more
intelligent
than
dolphins
and
they
spent
a
lot
of
their
time
in
behavioural
research
laboratories
running
round
inside
wheels
and
conducting
frighteningly
elegant
and
subtle
experiments
on
man
the
fact
that
once
again
man
completely
misinterpreted
this
relationship
was
entirely
according
to
these
creatures
plans
chapter
silently
the
aircar
coasted
through
the
cold
darkness
a
single
soft
glow
of
light
that
was
utterly
alone
in
the
deep
magrathean
night
it
sped
swiftly
arthur's
companion
seemed
sunk
in
his
own
thoughts
and
when
arthur
tried
on
a
couple
of
occasions
to
engage
him
in
conversation
again
he
would
simply
reply
by
asking
if
he
was
comfortable
enough
and
then
left
it
at
that
arthur
tried
to
gauge
the
speed
at
which
they
were
travelling
but
the
blackness
outside
was
absolute
and
he
was
denied
any
reference
points
the
sense
of
motion
was
so
soft
and
slight
he
could
almost
believe
they
were
hardly
moving
at
all
then
a
tiny
glow
of
light
appeared
in
the
far
distance
and
within
seconds
had
grown
so
much
in
size
that
arthur
realized
it
was
travelling
towards
them
at
a
colossal
speed
and
he
tried
to
make
out
what
sort
of
craft
it
might
be
he
peered
at
it
but
was
unable
to
discern
any
clear
shape
and
suddenly
gasped
in
alarm
as
the
aircraft
dipped
sharply
and
headed
downwards
in
what
seemed
certain
to
be
a
collision
course
their
relative
velocity
seemed
unbelievable
and
arthur
had
hardly
time
to
draw
breath
before
it
was
all
over
the
next
thing
he
was
aware
of
was
an
insane
silver
blur
that
seemed
to
surround
him
he
twisted
his
head
sharply
round
and
saw
a
small
black
point
dwindling
rapidly
in
the
distance
behind
them
and
it
took
him
several
seconds
to
realize
what
had
happened
they
had
plunged
into
a
tunnel
in
the
ground
the
colossal
speed
had
been
their
own
relative
to
the
glow
of
light
which
was
a
stationary
hole
in
the
ground
the
mouth
of
the
tunnel
the
insane
blur
of
silver
was
the
circular
wall
of
the
tunnel
down
which
they
were
shooting
apparently
at
several
hundred
miles
an
hour
he
closed
his
eyes
in
terror
after
a
length
of
time
which
he
made
no
attempt
to
judge
he
sensed
a
slight
subsidence
in
their
speed
and
some
while
later
became
aware
that
they
were
gradually
gliding
to
a
gentle
halt
he
opened
his
eyes
again
they
were
still
in
the
silver
tunnel
threading
and
weaving
their
way
through
what
appeared
to
be
a
crisscross
warren
of
converging
tunnels
when
they
finally
stopped
it
was
in
a
small
chamber
of
curved
steel
several
tunnels
also
had
their
terminus
here
and
at
the
farther
end
of
the
chamber
arthur
could
see
a
large
circle
of
dim
irritating
light
it
was
irritating
because
it
played
tricks
with
the
eyes
it
was
impossible
to
focus
on
it
properly
or
tell
how
near
or
far
it
was
arthur
guessed
quite
wrongly
that
it
might
be
ultra
violet
slartibartfast
turned
and
regarded
arthur
with
his
solemn
old
eyes
earthman
he
said
we
are
now
deep
in
the
heart
of
magrathea
how
did
you
know
i
was
an
earthman
demanded
arthur
these
things
will
become
clear
to
you
said
the
old
man
gently
at
least
he
added
with
slight
doubt
in
his
voice
clearer
than
they
are
at
the
moment
he
continued
i
should
warn
you
that
the
chamber
we
are
about
to
pass
into
does
not
literally
exist
within
our
planet
it
is
a
little
too
large
we
are
about
to
pass
through
a
gateway
into
a
vast
tract
of
hyperspace
it
may
disturb
you
arthur
made
nervous
noises
slartibartfast
touched
a
button
and
added
not
entirely
reassuringly
it
scares
the
willies
out
of
me
hold
tight
the
car
shot
forward
straight
into
the
circle
of
light
and
suddenly
arthur
had
a
fairly
clear
idea
of
what
infinity
looked
like
it
wasn't
infinity
in
fact
infinity
itself
looks
flat
and
uninteresting
looking
up
into
the
night
sky
is
looking
into
infinity
distance
is
incomprehensible
and
therefore
meaningless
the
chamber
into
which
the
aircar
emerged
was
anything
but
infinite
it
was
just
very
very
big
so
that
it
gave
the
impression
of
infinity
far
better
than
infinity
itself
arthur's
senses
bobbed
and
span
as
travelling
at
the
immense
speed
he
knew
the
aircar
attained
they
climbed
slowly
through
the
open
air
leaving
the
gateway
through
which
they
had
passed
an
invisible
pinprick
in
the
shimmering
wall
behind
them
the
wall
the
wall
defied
the
imagination
seduced
it
and
defeated
it
the
wall
was
so
paralysingly
vast
and
sheer
that
its
top
bottom
and
sides
passed
away
beyond
the
reach
of
sight
the
mere
shock
of
vertigo
could
kill
a
man
the
wall
appeared
perfectly
flat
it
would
take
the
finest
laser
measuring
equipment
to
detect
that
as
it
climbed
apparently
to
infinity
as
it
dropped
dizzily
away
as
it
planed
out
to
either
side
it
also
curved
it
met
itself
again
thirteen
light
seconds
away
in
other
words
the
wall
formed
the
inside
of
a
hollow
sphere
a
sphere
over
three
million
miles
across
and
flooded
with
unimaginable
light
welcome
said
slartibartfast
as
the
tiny
speck
that
was
the
aircar
travelling
now
at
three
times
the
speed
of
sound
crept
imperceptibly
forward
into
the
mindboggling
space
welcome
he
said
to
our
factory
floor
arthur
stared
about
him
in
a
kind
of
wonderful
horror
ranged
away
before
them
at
distances
he
could
neither
judge
nor
even
guess
at
were
a
series
of
curious
suspensions
delicate
traceries
of
metal
and
light
hung
about
shadowy
spherical
shapes
that
hung
in
the
space
this
said
slartibartfast
is
where
we
make
most
of
our
planets
you
see
you
mean
said
arthur
trying
to
form
the
words
you
mean
you're
starting
it
all
up
again
now
no
no
good
heavens
no
exclaimed
the
old
man
no
the
galaxy
isn't
nearly
rich
enough
to
support
us
yet
no
we've
been
awakened
to
perform
just
one
extraordinary
commission
for
very
special
clients
from
another
dimension
it
may
interest
you
there
in
the
distance
in
front
of
us
arthur
followed
the
old
man's
finger
till
he
was
able
to
pick
out
the
floating
structure
he
was
pointing
out
it
was
indeed
the
only
one
of
the
many
structures
that
betrayed
any
sign
of
activity
about
it
though
this
was
more
a
sublimal
impression
than
anything
one
could
put
one's
finger
on
at
the
moment
however
a
flash
of
light
arced
through
the
structure
and
revealed
in
stark
relief
the
patterns
that
were
formed
on
the
dark
sphere
within
patterns
that
arthur
knew
rough
blobby
shapes
that
were
as
familiar
to
him
as
the
shapes
of
words
part
of
the
furniture
of
his
mind
for
a
few
seconds
he
sat
in
stunned
silence
as
the
images
rushed
around
his
mind
and
tried
to
find
somewhere
to
settle
down
and
make
sense
part
of
his
brain
told
him
that
he
knew
perfectly
well
what
he
was
looking
at
and
what
the
shapes
represented
whilst
another
quite
sensibly
refused
to
countenance
the
idea
and
abdicated
responsibility
for
any
further
thinking
in
that
direction
the
flash
came
again
and
this
time
there
could
be
no
doubt
the
earth
whispered
arthur
well
the
earth
mark
two
in
fact
said
slartibartfast
cheerfully
we're
making
a
copy
from
our
original
blueprints
there
was
a
pause
are
you
trying
to
tell
me
said
arthur
slowly
and
with
control
that
you
originally
made
the
earth
oh
yes
said
slartibartfast
did
you
ever
go
to
a
place
i
think
it
was
called
norway
no
said
arthur
no
i
didn't
pity
said
slartibartfast
that
was
one
of
mine
won
an
award
you
know
lovely
crinkly
edges
i
was
most
upset
to
hear
about
its
destruction
you
were
upset
yes
five
minutes
later
and
it
wouldn't
have
mattered
so
much
it
was
a
quite
shocking
cockup
huh
said
arthur
the
mice
were
furious
the
mice
were
furious
oh
yes
said
the
old
man
mildly
yes
well
so
i
expect
were
the
dogs
and
cats
and
duckbilled
platypuses
but
ah
but
they
hadn't
paid
for
it
you
see
had
they
look
said
arthur
would
it
save
you
a
lot
of
time
if
i
just
gave
up
and
went
mad
now
for
a
while
the
aircar
flew
on
in
awkward
silence
then
the
old
man
tried
patiently
to
explain
earthman
the
planet
you
lived
on
was
commissioned
paid
for
and
run
by
mice
it
was
destroyed
five
minutes
before
the
completion
of
the
purpose
for
which
it
was
built
and
we've
got
to
build
another
one
only
one
word
registered
with
arthur
mice
he
said
indeed
earthman
look
sorry
are
we
talking
about
the
little
white
furry
things
with
the
cheese
fixation
and
women
standing
on
tables
screaming
in
early
sixties
sit
coms
slartibartfast
coughed
politely
earthman
he
said
it
is
sometimes
hard
to
follow
your
mode
of
speech
remember
i
have
been
asleep
inside
this
planet
of
magrathea
for
five
million
years
and
know
little
of
these
early
sixties
sit
coms
of
which
you
speak
these
creatures
you
call
mice
you
see
they
are
not
quite
as
they
appear
they
are
merely
the
protrusion
into
our
dimension
of
vast
hyperintelligent
pan
dimensional
beings
the
whole
business
with
the
cheese
and
the
squeaking
is
just
a
front
the
old
man
paused
and
with
a
sympathetic
frown
continued
they've
been
experimenting
on
you
i'm
afraid
arthur
thought
about
this
for
a
second
and
then
his
face
cleared
ah
no
he
said
i
see
the
source
of
the
misunderstanding
now
no
look
you
see
what
happened
was
that
we
used
to
do
experiments
on
them
they
were
often
used
in
behavioural
research
pavlov
and
all
that
sort
of
stuff
so
what
happened
was
hat
the
mice
would
be
set
all
sorts
of
tests
learning
to
ring
bells
run
around
mazes
and
things
so
that
the
whole
nature
of
the
learning
process
could
be
examined
from
our
observations
of
their
behaviour
we
were
able
to
learn
all
sorts
of
things
about
our
own
arthur's
voice
tailed
off
such
subtlety
said
slartibartfast
one
has
to
admire
it
what
said
arthur
how
better
to
disguise
their
real
natures
and
how
better
to
guide
your
thinking
suddenly
running
down
a
maze
the
wrong
way
eating
the
wrong
bit
of
cheese
unexpectedly
dropping
dead
of
myxomatosis
if
it's
finely
calculated
the
cumulative
effect
is
enormous
he
paused
for
effect
you
see
earthman
they
really
are
particularly
clever
hyperintelligent
pandimensional
beings
your
planet
and
people
have
formed
the
matrix
of
an
organic
computer
running
a
ten
millionyear
research
programme
let
me
tell
you
the
whole
story
it'll
take
a
little
time
time
said
arthur
weakly
is
not
currently
one
of
my
problems
chapter
there
are
of
course
many
problems
connected
with
life
of
which
some
of
the
most
popular
are
why
are
people
born
why
do
they
die
why
do
they
want
to
spend
so
much
of
the
intervening
time
wearing
digital
watches
many
many
millions
of
years
ago
a
race
of
hyperintelligent
pan
dimensional
beings
whose
physical
manifestation
in
their
own
pandimensional
universe
is
not
dissimilar
to
our
own
got
so
fed
up
with
the
constant
bickering
about
the
meaning
of
life
which
used
to
interrupt
their
favourite
pastime
of
brockian
ultra
cricket
a
curious
game
which
involved
suddenly
hitting
people
for
no
readily
apparent
reason
and
then
running
away
that
they
decided
to
sit
down
and
solve
their
problems
once
and
for
all
and
to
this
end
they
built
themselves
a
stupendous
super
computer
which
was
so
amazingly
intelligent
that
even
before
the
data
banks
had
been
connected
up
it
had
started
from
i
think
therefore
i
am
and
got
as
far
as
the
existence
of
rice
pudding
and
income
tax
before
anyone
managed
to
turn
it
off
it
was
the
size
of
a
small
city
its
main
console
was
installed
in
a
specially
designed
executive
office
mounted
on
an
enormous
executive
desk
of
finest
ultramahagony
topped
with
rich
ultrared
leather
the
dark
carpeting
was
discreetly
sumptuous
exotic
pot
plants
and
tastefully
engraved
prints
of
the
principal
computer
programmers
and
their
families
were
deployed
liberally
about
the
room
and
stately
windows
looked
out
upon
a
treelined
public
square
on
the
day
of
the
great
onturning
two
soberly
dressed
programmers
with
brief
cases
arrived
and
were
shown
discreetly
into
the
office
they
were
aware
that
this
day
they
would
represent
their
entire
race
in
its
greatest
moment
but
they
conducted
themselves
calmly
and
quietly
as
they
seated
themselves
deferentially
before
the
desk
opened
their
brief
cases
and
took
out
their
leatherbound
notebooks
their
names
were
lunkwill
and
fook
for
a
few
moments
they
sat
in
respectful
silence
then
after
exchanging
a
quiet
glance
with
fook
lunkwill
leaned
forward
and
touched
a
small
black
panel
the
subtlest
of
hums
indicated
that
the
massive
computer
was
now
in
total
active
mode
after
a
pause
it
spoke
to
them
in
a
voice
rich
resonant
and
deep
it
said
what
is
this
great
task
for
which
i
deep
thought
the
second
greatest
computer
in
the
universe
of
time
and
space
have
been
called
into
existence
lunkwill
and
fook
glanced
at
each
other
in
surprise
your
task
o
computer
began
fook
no
wait
a
minute
this
isn't
right
said
lunkwill
worried
we
distinctly
designed
this
computer
to
be
the
greatest
one
ever
and
we're
not
making
do
with
second
best
deep
thought
he
addressed
the
computer
are
you
not
as
we
designed
you
to
be
the
greatest
most
powerful
computer
in
all
time
i
described
myself
as
the
second
greatest
intoned
deep
thought
and
such
i
am
another
worried
look
passed
between
the
two
programmers
lunkwill
cleared
his
throat
there
must
be
some
mistake
he
said
are
you
not
a
greatest
computer
than
the
milliard
gargantubrain
which
can
count
all
the
atoms
in
a
star
in
a
millisecond
the
milliard
gargantubrain
said
deep
thought
with
unconcealed
contempt
a
mere
abacus
mention
it
not
and
are
you
not
said
fook
leaning
anxiously
forward
a
greater
analyst
than
the
googleplex
star
thinker
in
the
seventh
galaxy
of
light
and
ingenuity
which
can
calculate
the
trajectory
of
every
single
dust
particle
throughout
a
fiveweek
dangrabad
beta
sand
blizzard
a
fiveweek
sand
blizzard
said
deep
thought
haughtily
you
ask
this
of
me
who
have
contemplated
the
very
vectors
of
the
atoms
in
the
big
bang
itself
molest
me
not
with
this
pocket
calculator
stuff
the
two
programmers
sat
in
uncomfortable
silence
for
a
moment
then
lunkwill
leaned
forward
again
but
are
you
not
he
said
a
more
fiendish
disputant
than
the
great
hyperlobic
omnicognate
neutron
wrangler
of
ciceronicus
the
magic
and
indefatigable
the
great
hyperlobic
omnicognate
neutron
wrangler
said
deep
thought
thoroughly
rolling
the
r's
could
talk
all
four
legs
off
an
arcturan
megadonkey
but
only
i
could
persuade
it
to
go
for
a
walk
afterwards
then
what
asked
fook
is
the
problem
there
is
no
problem
said
deep
thought
with
magnificent
ringing
tones
i
am
simply
the
second
greatest
computer
in
the
universe
of
space
and
time
but
the
second
insisted
lunkwill
why
do
you
keep
saying
the
second
you're
surely
not
thinking
of
the
multicorticoid
perspicutron
titan
muller
are
you
or
the
pondermatic
or
the
contemptuous
lights
flashed
across
the
computer's
console
i
spare
not
a
single
unit
of
thought
on
these
cybernetic
simpletons
he
boomed
i
speak
of
none
but
the
computer
that
is
to
come
after
me
fook
was
losing
patience
he
pushed
his
notebook
aside
and
muttered
i
think
this
is
getting
needlessly
messianic
you
know
nothing
of
future
time
pronounced
deep
thought
and
yet
in
my
teeming
circuitry
i
can
navigate
the
infinite
delta
streams
of
future
probability
and
see
that
there
must
one
day
come
a
computer
whose
merest
operational
parameters
i
am
not
worthy
to
calculate
but
which
it
will
be
my
fate
eventually
to
design
fook
sighed
heavily
and
glanced
across
to
lunkwill
can
we
get
on
and
ask
the
question
he
said
lunkwill
motioned
him
to
wait
what
computer
is
this
of
which
you
speak
he
asked
i
will
speak
of
it
no
further
in
this
present
time
said
deep
thought
now
ask
what
else
of
me
you
will
that
i
may
function
speak
they
shrugged
at
each
other
fook
composed
himself
o
deep
thought
computer
he
said
the
task
we
have
designed
you
to
perform
is
this
we
want
you
to
tell
us
he
paused
the
answer
the
answer
said
deep
thought
the
answer
to
what
life
urged
fook
the
universe
said
lunkwill
everything
they
said
in
chorus
deep
thought
paused
for
a
moment's
reflection
tricky
he
said
finally
but
can
you
do
it
again
a
significant
pause
yes
said
deep
thought
i
can
do
it
there
is
an
answer
said
fook
with
breathless
excitement
a
simple
answer
added
lunkwill
yes
said
deep
thought
life
the
universe
and
everything
there
is
an
answer
but
he
added
i'll
have
to
think
about
it
a
sudden
commotion
destroyed
the
moment
the
door
flew
open
and
two
angry
men
wearing
the
coarse
fadedblue
robes
and
belts
of
the
cruxwan
university
burst
into
the
room
thrusting
aside
the
ineffectual
flunkies
who
tried
to
bar
their
way
we
demand
admission
shouted
the
younger
of
the
two
men
elbowing
a
pretty
young
secretary
in
the
throat
come
on
shouted
the
older
one
you
can't
keep
us
out
he
pushed
a
junior
programmer
back
through
the
door
we
demand
that
you
can't
keep
us
out
bawled
the
younger
one
though
he
was
now
firmly
inside
the
room
and
no
further
attempts
were
being
made
to
stop
him
who
are
you
said
lunkwill
rising
angrily
from
his
seat
what
do
you
want
i
am
majikthise
announced
the
older
one
and
i
demand
that
i
am
vroomfondel
shouted
the
younger
one
majikthise
turned
on
vroomfondel
it's
alright
he
explained
angrily
you
don't
need
to
demand
that
alright
bawled
vroomfondel
banging
on
an
nearby
desk
i
am
vroomfondel
and
that
is
not
a
demand
that
is
a
solid
fact
what
we
demand
is
solid
facts
no
we
don't
exclaimed
majikthise
in
irritation
that
is
precisely
what
we
don't
demand
scarcely
pausing
for
breath
vroomfondel
shouted
we
don't
demand
solid
facts
what
we
demand
is
a
total
absence
of
solid
facts
i
demand
that
i
may
or
may
not
be
vroomfondel
but
who
the
devil
are
you
exclaimed
an
outraged
fook
we
said
majikthise
are
philosophers
though
we
may
not
be
said
vroomfondel
waving
a
warning
finger
at
the
programmers
yes
we
are
insisted
majikthise
we
are
quite
definitely
here
as
representatives
of
the
amalgamated
union
of
philosophers
sages
luminaries
and
other
thinking
persons
and
we
want
this
machine
off
and
we
want
it
off
now
what's
the
problem
said
lunkwill
i'll
tell
you
what
the
problem
is
mate
said
majikthise
demarcation
that's
the
problem
we
demand
yelled
vroomfondel
that
demarcation
may
or
may
not
be
the
problem
you
just
let
the
machines
get
on
with
the
adding
up
warned
majikthise
and
we'll
take
care
of
the
eternal
verities
thank
you
very
much
you
want
to
check
your
legal
position
you
do
mate
under
law
the
quest
for
ultimate
truth
is
quite
clearly
the
inalienable
prerogative
of
your
working
thinkers
any
bloody
machine
goes
and
actually
finds
it
and
we're
straight
out
of
a
job
aren't
we
i
mean
what's
the
use
of
our
sitting
up
half
the
night
arguing
that
there
may
or
may
not
be
a
god
if
this
machine
only
goes
and
gives
us
his
bleeding
phone
number
the
next
morning
that's
right
shouted
vroomfondel
we
demand
rigidly
defined
areas
of
doubt
and
uncertainty
suddenly
a
stentorian
voice
boomed
across
the
room
might
i
make
an
observation
at
this
point
inquired
deep
thought
we'll
go
on
strike
yelled
vroomfondel
that's
right
agreed
majikthise
you'll
have
a
national
philosopher's
strike
on
your
hands
the
hum
level
in
the
room
suddenly
increased
as
several
ancillary
bass
driver
units
mounted
in
sedately
carved
and
varnished
cabinet
speakers
around
the
room
cut
in
to
give
deep
thought's
voice
a
little
more
power
all
i
wanted
to
say
bellowed
the
computer
is
that
my
circuits
are
now
irrevocably
committed
to
calculating
the
answer
to
the
ultimate
question
of
life
the
universe
and
everything
he
paused
and
satisfied
himself
that
he
now
had
everyone's
attention
before
continuing
more
quietly
but
the
programme
will
take
me
a
little
while
to
run
fook
glanced
impatiently
at
his
watch
how
long
he
said
seven
and
a
half
million
years
said
deep
thought
lunkwill
and
fook
blinked
at
each
other
seven
and
a
half
million
years
they
cried
in
chorus
yes
declaimed
deep
thought
i
said
i'd
have
to
think
about
it
didn't
i
and
it
occurs
to
me
that
running
a
programme
like
this
is
bound
to
create
an
enormous
amount
of
popular
publicity
for
the
whole
area
of
philosophy
in
general
everyone's
going
to
have
their
own
theories
about
what
answer
i'm
eventually
to
come
up
with
and
who
better
to
capitalize
on
that
media
market
than
you
yourself
so
long
as
you
can
keep
disagreeing
with
each
other
violently
enough
and
slagging
each
other
off
in
the
popular
press
you
can
keep
yourself
on
the
gravy
train
for
life
how
does
that
sound
the
two
philosophers
gaped
at
him
bloody
hell
said
majikthise
now
that
is
what
i
call
thinking
here
vroomfondel
why
do
we
never
think
of
things
like
that
dunno
said
vroomfondel
in
an
awed
whisper
think
our
brains
must
be
too
highly
trained
majikthise
so
saying
they
turned
on
their
heels
and
walked
out
of
the
door
and
into
a
lifestyle
beyond
their
wildest
dreams
chapter
yes
very
salutary
said
arthur
after
slartibartfast
had
related
the
salient
points
of
the
story
to
him
but
i
don't
understand
what
all
this
has
got
to
do
with
the
earth
and
mice
and
things
that
is
but
the
first
half
of
the
story
earthman
said
the
old
man
if
you
would
care
to
discover
what
happened
seven
and
a
half
millions
later
on
the
great
day
of
the
answer
allow
me
to
invite
you
to
my
study
where
you
can
experience
the
events
yourself
on
our
sensotape
records
that
is
unless
you
would
care
to
take
a
quick
stroll
on
the
surface
of
new
earth
it's
only
half
completed
i'm
afraid
we
haven't
even
finished
burying
the
artificial
dinosaur
skeletons
in
the
crust
yet
then
we
have
the
tertiary
and
quarternary
periods
of
the
cenozoic
era
to
lay
down
and
no
thank
you
said
arthur
it
wouldn't
be
quite
the
same
no
said
slartibartfast
it
won't
be
and
he
turned
the
aircar
round
and
headed
back
towards
the
mindnumbing
wall
chapter
slartibartfast's
study
was
a
total
mess
like
the
results
of
an
explosion
in
a
public
library
the
old
man
frowned
as
they
stepped
in
terribly
unfortunate
he
said
a
diode
blew
in
one
of
the
lifesupport
computers
when
we
tried
to
revive
our
cleaning
staff
we
discovered
they'd
been
dead
for
nearly
thirty
thousand
years
who's
going
to
clear
away
the
bodies
that's
what
i
want
to
know
look
why
don't
you
sit
yourself
down
over
there
and
let
me
plug
you
in
he
gestured
arthur
towards
a
chair
which
looked
as
if
it
had
been
made
out
of
the
rib
cage
of
a
stegosaurus
it
was
made
out
of
the
rib
cage
of
a
stegosaurus
explained
the
old
man
as
he
pottered
about
fishing
bits
of
wire
out
from
under
tottering
piles
of
paper
and
drawing
instruments
here
he
said
hold
these
and
passed
a
couple
of
stripped
wire
end
to
arthur
the
instant
he
took
hold
of
them
a
bird
flew
straight
through
him
he
was
suspended
in
midair
and
totally
invisible
to
himself
beneath
him
was
a
pretty
treelined
city
square
and
all
around
it
as
far
as
the
eye
could
see
were
white
concrete
buildings
of
airy
spacious
design
but
somewhat
the
worse
for
wear
many
were
cracked
and
stained
with
rain
today
however
the
sun
was
shining
a
fresh
breeze
danced
lightly
through
the
trees
and
the
odd
sensation
that
all
the
buildings
were
quietly
humming
was
probably
caused
by
the
fact
that
the
square
and
all
the
streets
around
it
were
thronged
with
cheerful
excited
people
somewhere
a
band
was
playing
brightly
coloured
flags
were
fluttering
in
the
breeze
and
the
spirit
of
carnival
was
in
the
air
arthur
felt
extraordinarily
lonely
stuck
up
in
the
air
above
it
all
without
so
much
as
a
body
to
his
name
but
before
he
had
time
to
reflect
on
this
a
voice
rang
out
across
the
square
and
called
for
everyone's
attention
a
man
standing
on
a
brightly
dressed
dais
before
the
building
which
clearly
dominated
the
square
was
addressing
the
crowd
over
a
tannoy
o
people
waiting
in
the
shadow
of
deep
thought
he
cried
out
honoured
descendants
of
vroomfondel
and
majikthise
the
greatest
and
most
truly
interesting
pundits
the
universe
has
ever
known
the
time
of
waiting
is
over
wild
cheers
broke
out
amongst
the
crowd
flags
streamers
and
wolf
whistles
sailed
through
the
air
the
narrower
streets
looked
rather
like
centipedes
rolled
over
on
their
backs
and
frantically
waving
their
legs
in
the
air
seven
and
a
half
million
years
our
race
has
waited
for
this
great
and
hopefully
enlightening
day
cried
the
cheer
leader
the
day
of
the
answer
hurrahs
burst
from
the
ecstatic
crowd
never
again
cried
the
man
never
again
will
we
wake
up
in
the
morning
and
think
who
am
i
what
is
my
purpose
in
life
does
it
really
cosmically
speaking
matter
if
i
don't
get
up
and
go
to
work
for
today
we
will
finally
learn
once
and
for
all
the
plain
and
simple
answer
to
all
these
nagging
little
problems
of
life
the
universe
and
everything
as
the
crowd
erupted
once
again
arthur
found
himself
gliding
through
the
air
and
down
towards
one
of
the
large
stately
windows
on
the
first
floor
of
the
building
behind
the
dais
from
which
the
speaker
was
addressing
the
crowd
he
experienced
a
moment's
panic
as
he
sailed
straight
through
towards
the
window
which
passed
when
a
second
or
so
later
he
found
he
had
gone
right
through
the
solid
glass
without
apparently
touching
it
no
one
in
the
room
remarked
on
his
peculiar
arrival
which
is
hardly
surprising
as
he
wasn't
there
he
began
to
realize
that
the
whole
experience
was
merely
a
recorded
projection
which
knocked
sixtrack
seventymillimetre
into
a
cocked
hat
the
room
was
much
as
slartibartfast
had
described
it
in
seven
and
a
half
million
years
it
had
been
well
looked
after
and
cleaned
regularly
every
century
or
so
the
ultramahagony
desk
was
worn
at
the
edges
the
carpet
a
little
faded
now
but
the
large
computer
terminal
sat
in
sparkling
glory
on
the
desk's
leather
top
as
bright
as
if
it
had
been
constructed
yesterday
two
severely
dressed
men
sat
respectfully
before
the
terminal
and
waited
the
time
is
nearly
upon
us
said
one
and
arthur
was
surprised
to
see
a
word
suddenly
materialize
in
thin
air
just
by
the
man's
neck
the
word
was
loonquawl
and
it
flashed
a
couple
of
times
and
the
disappeared
again
before
arthur
was
able
to
assimilate
this
the
other
man
spoke
and
the
word
phouchg
appeared
by
his
neck
seventyfive
thousand
generations
ago
our
ancestors
set
this
program
in
motion
the
second
man
said
and
in
all
that
time
we
will
be
the
first
to
hear
the
computer
speak
an
awesome
prospect
phouchg
agreed
the
first
man
and
arthur
suddenly
realized
that
he
was
watching
a
recording
with
subtitles
we
are
the
ones
who
will
hear
said
phouchg
the
answer
to
the
great
question
of
life
the
universe
said
loonquawl
and
everything
shhh
said
loonquawl
with
a
slight
gesture
i
think
deep
thought
is
preparing
to
speak
there
was
a
moment's
expectant
pause
whilst
panels
slowly
came
to
life
on
the
front
of
the
console
lights
flashed
on
and
off
experimentally
and
settled
down
into
a
businesslike
pattern
a
soft
low
hum
came
from
the
communication
channel
good
morning
said
deep
thought
at
last
er
good
morning
o
deep
thought
said
loonquawl
nervously
do
you
have
er
that
is
an
answer
for
you
interrupted
deep
thought
majestically
yes
i
have
the
two
men
shivered
with
expectancy
their
waiting
had
not
been
in
vain
there
really
is
one
breathed
phouchg
there
really
is
one
confirmed
deep
thought
to
everything
to
the
great
question
of
life
the
universe
and
everything
yes
both
of
the
men
had
been
trained
for
this
moment
their
lives
had
been
a
preparation
for
it
they
had
been
selected
at
birth
as
those
who
would
witness
the
answer
but
even
so
they
found
themselves
gasping
and
squirming
like
excited
children
and
you're
ready
to
give
it
to
us
urged
loonquawl
i
am
now
now
said
deep
thought
they
both
licked
their
dry
lips
though
i
don't
think
added
deep
thought
that
you're
going
to
like
it
doesn't
matter
said
phouchg
we
must
know
it
now
now
inquired
deep
thought
yes
now
alright
said
the
computer
and
settled
into
silence
again
the
two
men
fidgeted
the
tension
was
unbearable
you're
really
not
going
to
like
it
observed
deep
thought
tell
us
alright
said
deep
thought
the
answer
to
the
great
question
yes
of
life
the
universe
and
everything
said
deep
thought
yes
is
said
deep
thought
and
paused
yes
is
yes
fortytwo
said
deep
thought
with
infinite
majesty
and
calm
chapter
it
was
a
long
time
before
anyone
spoke
out
of
the
corner
of
his
eye
phouchg
could
see
the
sea
of
tense
expectant
faces
down
in
the
square
outside
we're
going
to
get
lynched
aren't
we
he
whispered
it
was
a
tough
assignment
said
deep
thought
mildly
fortytwo
yelled
loonquawl
is
that
all
you've
got
to
show
for
seven
and
a
half
million
years
work
i
checked
it
very
thoroughly
said
the
computer
and
that
quite
definitely
is
the
answer
i
think
the
problem
to
be
quite
honest
with
you
is
that
you've
never
actually
known
what
the
question
is
but
it
was
the
great
question
the
ultimate
question
of
life
the
universe
and
everything
howled
loonquawl
yes
said
deep
thought
with
the
air
of
one
who
suffers
fools
gladly
but
what
actually
is
it
a
slow
stupefied
silence
crept
over
the
men
as
they
stared
at
the
computer
and
then
at
each
other
well
you
know
it's
just
everything
everything
offered
phouchg
weakly
exactly
said
deep
thought
so
once
you
do
know
what
the
question
actually
is
you'll
know
what
the
answer
means
oh
terrific
muttered
phouchg
flinging
aside
his
notebook
and
wiping
away
a
tiny
tear
look
alright
alright
said
loonquawl
can
you
just
please
tell
us
the
question
the
ultimate
question
yes
of
life
the
universe
and
everything
yes
deep
thought
pondered
this
for
a
moment
tricky
he
said
but
can
you
do
it
cried
loonquawl
deep
thought
pondered
this
for
another
long
moment
finally
no
he
said
firmly
both
men
collapsed
on
to
their
chairs
in
despair
but
i'll
tell
you
who
can
said
deep
thought
they
both
looked
up
sharply
who
tell
us
suddenly
arthur
began
to
feel
his
apparently
nonexistent
scalp
begin
to
crawl
as
he
found
himself
moving
slowly
but
inexorably
forward
towards
the
console
but
it
was
only
a
dramatic
zoom
on
the
part
of
whoever
had
made
the
recording
he
assumed
i
speak
of
none
other
than
the
computer
that
is
to
come
after
me
intoned
deep
thought
his
voice
regaining
its
accustomed
declamatory
tones
a
computer
whose
merest
operational
parameters
i
am
not
worthy
to
calculate
and
yet
i
will
design
it
for
you
a
computer
which
can
calculate
the
question
to
the
ultimate
answer
a
computer
of
such
infinite
and
subtle
complexity
that
organic
life
itself
shall
form
part
of
its
operational
matrix
and
you
yourselves
shall
take
on
new
forms
and
go
down
into
the
computer
to
navigate
its
tenmillionyear
program
yes
i
shall
design
this
computer
for
you
and
i
shall
name
it
also
unto
you
and
it
shall
be
called
the
earth
phouchg
gaped
at
deep
thought
what
a
dull
name
he
said
and
great
incisions
appeared
down
the
length
of
his
body
loonquawl
too
suddenly
sustained
horrific
gashed
from
nowhere
the
computer
console
blotched
and
cracked
the
walls
flickered
and
crumbled
and
the
room
crashed
upwards
into
its
own
ceiling
slartibartfast
was
standing
in
front
of
arthur
holding
the
two
wires
end
of
the
tape
he
explained
chapter
zaphod
wake
up
mmmmmwwwwwerrrrr
hey
come
on
wake
up
just
let
me
stick
to
what
i'm
good
at
yeah
muttered
zaphod
and
rolled
away
from
the
voice
back
to
sleep
do
you
want
me
to
kick
you
said
ford
would
it
give
you
a
lot
of
pleasure
said
zaphod
blearily
no
nor
me
so
what's
the
point
stop
bugging
me
zaphod
curled
himself
up
he
got
a
double
dose
of
the
gas
said
trillian
looking
down
at
him
two
windpipes
and
stop
talking
said
zaphod
it's
hard
enough
trying
to
sleep
anyway
what's
the
matter
with
the
ground
it's
all
cold
and
hard
it's
gold
said
ford
with
an
amazingly
balletic
movement
zaphod
was
standing
and
scanning
the
horizon
because
that
was
how
far
the
gold
ground
stretched
in
every
direction
perfectly
smooth
and
solid
it
gleamed
like
it's
impossible
to
say
what
it
gleamed
like
because
nothing
in
the
universe
gleams
in
quite
the
same
way
that
a
planet
of
solid
gold
does
who
put
all
that
there
yelped
zaphod
goggleeyed
don't
get
excited
said
ford
it's
only
a
catalogue
a
who
a
catalogue
said
trillian
an
illusion
how
can
you
say
that
cried
zaphod
falling
to
his
hands
and
knees
and
staring
at
the
ground
he
poked
it
and
prodded
it
with
his
fingernail
it
was
very
heavy
and
very
slightly
soft
he
could
mark
it
with
his
fingernail
it
was
very
yellow
and
very
shiny
and
when
he
breathed
on
it
his
breath
evaporated
off
it
in
that
very
peculiar
and
special
way
that
breath
evaporates
off
solid
gold
trillian
and
i
came
round
a
while
ago
said
ford
we
shouted
and
yelled
till
somebody
came
and
then
carried
on
shouting
and
yelling
till
they
got
fed
up
and
put
us
in
their
planet
catalogue
to
keep
us
busy
till
they
were
ready
to
deal
with
us
this
is
all
sensotape
zaphod
stared
at
him
bitterly
ah
shit
he
said
you
wake
me
up
from
my
own
perfectly
good
dream
to
show
me
somebody
else's
he
sat
down
in
a
huff
what's
that
series
of
valleys
over
there
he
said
hallmark
said
ford
we
had
a
look
we
didn't
wake
you
earlier
said
trillian
the
last
planet
was
knee
deep
in
fish
fish
some
people
like
the
oddest
things
and
before
that
said
ford
we
had
platinum
bit
dull
we
thought
you'd
like
to
see
this
one
though
seas
of
light
glared
at
them
in
one
solid
blaze
wherever
they
looked
very
pretty
said
zaphod
petulantly
in
the
sky
a
huge
green
catalogue
number
appeared
it
flickered
and
changed
and
when
they
looked
around
again
so
had
the
land
as
with
one
voice
they
all
went
yuch
the
sea
was
purple
the
beach
they
were
on
was
composed
of
tiny
yellow
and
green
pebbles
presumably
terribly
precious
stones
the
mountains
in
the
distance
seemed
soft
and
undulating
with
red
peaks
nearby
stood
a
solid
silver
beach
table
with
a
frilly
mauve
parasol
and
silver
tassles
in
the
sky
a
huge
sign
appeared
replacing
the
catalogue
number
it
said
whatever
your
tastes
magrathea
can
cater
for
you
we
are
not
proud
and
five
hundred
entirely
naked
women
dropped
out
of
the
sky
on
parachutes
in
a
moment
the
scene
vanished
and
left
them
in
a
springtime
meadow
full
of
cows
ow
said
zaphod
my
brains
you
want
to
talk
about
it
said
ford
yeah
ok
said
zaphod
and
all
three
sat
down
and
ignored
the
scenes
that
came
and
went
around
them
i
figure
this
said
zaphod
whatever
happened
to
my
mind
i
did
it
and
i
did
it
in
such
a
way
that
it
wouldn't
be
detected
by
the
government
screening
tests
and
i
wasn't
to
know
anything
about
it
myself
pretty
crazy
right
the
other
two
nodded
in
agreement
so
i
reckon
what's
so
secret
that
i
can't
let
anybody
know
i
know
it
not
the
galactic
government
not
even
myself
and
the
answer
is
i
don't
know
obviously
but
i
put
a
few
things
together
and
i
can
begin
to
guess
when
did
i
decide
to
run
for
president
shortly
after
the
death
of
president
yooden
vranx
you
remember
yooden
ford
yeah
said
ford
he
was
that
guy
we
met
when
we
were
kids
the
arcturan
captain
he
was
a
gas
he
gave
us
conkers
when
you
bust
your
way
into
his
megafreighter
said
you
were
the
most
amazing
kid
he'd
ever
met
what's
all
this
said
trillian
ancient
history
said
ford
when
we
were
kids
together
on
betelgeuse
the
arcturan
megafreighters
used
to
carry
most
of
the
bulky
trade
between
the
galactic
centre
and
the
outlying
regions
the
betelgeuse
trading
scouts
used
to
find
the
markets
and
the
arcturans
would
supply
them
there
was
a
lot
of
trouble
with
space
pirates
before
they
were
wiped
out
in
the
dordellis
wars
and
the
megafreighters
had
to
be
equipped
with
the
most
fantastic
defence
shields
known
to
galactic
science
they
were
real
brutes
of
ships
and
huge
in
orbit
round
a
planet
they
would
eclipse
the
sun
one
day
young
zaphod
here
decides
to
raid
one
on
a
trijet
scooter
designed
for
stratosphere
work
a
mere
kid
i
mean
forget
it
it
was
crazier
than
a
mad
monkey
i
went
along
for
the
ride
because
i'd
got
some
very
safe
money
on
him
not
doing
it
and
didn't
want
him
coming
back
with
fake
evidence
so
what
happens
we
got
in
his
trijet
which
he
had
souped
up
into
something
totally
other
crossed
three
parsecs
in
a
matter
of
weeks
bust
our
way
into
a
megafreighter
i
still
don't
know
how
marched
on
to
the
bridge
waving
toy
pistols
and
demanded
conkers
a
wilder
thing
i
have
not
known
lost
me
a
year's
pocket
money
for
what
conkers
the
captain
was
this
really
amazing
guy
yooden
vranx
said
zaphod
he
gave
us
food
booze
stuff
from
really
weird
parts
of
the
galaxy
lots
of
conkers
of
course
and
we
had
just
the
most
incredible
time
then
he
teleported
us
back
into
the
maximum
security
wing
of
betelgeuse
state
prison
he
was
a
cool
guy
went
on
to
become
president
of
the
galaxy
zaphod
paused
the
scene
around
them
was
currently
plunged
into
gloom
dark
mists
swirled
round
them
and
elephantine
shapes
lurked
indistinctly
in
the
shadows
the
air
was
occasionally
rent
with
the
sounds
of
illusory
beings
murdering
other
illusory
beings
presumably
enough
people
must
have
liked
this
sort
of
thing
to
make
it
a
paying
proposition
ford
said
zaphod
quietly
yeah
just
before
yooden
died
he
came
to
see
me
what
you
never
told
me
no
what
did
he
say
what
did
he
come
to
see
you
about
he
told
me
about
the
heart
of
gold
it
was
his
idea
that
i
should
steal
it
his
idea
yeah
said
zaphod
and
the
only
possible
way
of
stealing
it
was
to
be
at
the
launching
ceremony
ford
gaped
at
him
in
astonishment
for
a
moment
and
then
roared
with
laughter
are
you
telling
me
he
said
that
you
set
yourself
up
to
become
president
of
the
galaxy
just
to
steal
that
ship
that's
it
said
zaphod
with
the
sort
of
grin
that
would
get
most
people
locked
away
in
a
room
with
soft
walls
but
why
said
ford
what's
so
important
about
having
it
dunno
said
zaphod
i
think
if
i'd
consciously
known
what
was
so
important
about
it
and
what
i
would
need
it
for
it
would
have
showed
up
on
the
brain
screening
tests
and
i
would
never
have
passed
i
think
yooden
told
me
a
lot
of
things
that
are
still
locked
away
so
you
think
you
went
and
mucked
about
inside
your
own
brain
as
a
result
of
yooden
talking
to
you
he
was
a
hell
of
a
talker
yeah
but
zaphod
old
mate
you
want
to
look
after
yourself
you
know
zaphod
shrugged
i
mean
don't
you
have
any
inkling
of
the
reasons
for
all
this
asked
ford
zaphod
thought
hard
about
this
and
doubts
seemed
to
cross
his
minds
no
he
said
at
last
i
don't
seem
to
be
letting
myself
into
any
of
my
secrets
still
he
added
on
further
reflection
i
can
understand
that
i
wouldn't
trust
myself
further
than
i
could
spit
a
rat
a
moment
later
the
last
planet
in
the
catalogue
vanished
from
beneath
them
and
the
solid
world
resolved
itself
again
they
were
sitting
in
a
plush
waiting
room
full
of
glasstop
tables
and
design
awards
a
tall
magrathean
man
was
standing
in
front
of
them
the
mice
will
see
you
now
he
said
chapter
so
there
you
have
it
said
slartibartfast
making
a
feeble
and
perfunctory
attempt
to
clear
away
some
of
the
appalling
mess
of
his
study
he
picked
up
a
paper
from
the
top
of
a
pile
but
then
couldn't
think
of
anywhere
else
to
put
it
so
he
but
it
back
on
top
of
the
original
pile
which
promptly
fell
over
deep
thought
designed
the
earth
we
built
it
and
you
lived
on
it
and
the
vogons
came
and
destroyed
it
five
minutes
before
the
program
was
completed
added
arthur
not
unbitterly
yes
said
the
old
man
pausing
to
gaze
hopelessly
round
the
room
ten
million
years
of
planning
and
work
gone
just
like
that
ten
million
years
earthman
can
you
conceive
of
that
kind
of
time
span
a
galactic
civilization
could
grow
from
a
single
worm
five
times
over
in
that
time
gone
he
paused
well
that's
bureaucracy
for
you
he
added
you
know
said
arthur
thoughtfully
all
this
explains
a
lot
of
things
all
through
my
life
i've
had
this
strange
unaccountable
feeling
that
something
was
going
on
in
the
world
something
big
even
sinister
and
no
one
would
tell
me
what
it
was
no
said
the
old
man
that's
just
perfectly
normal
paranoia
everyone
in
the
universe
has
that
everyone
said
arthur
well
if
everyone
has
that
perhaps
it
means
something
perhaps
somewhere
outside
the
universe
we
know
maybe
who
cares
said
slartibartfast
before
arthur
got
too
excited
perhaps
i'm
old
and
tired
he
continued
but
i
always
think
that
the
chances
of
finding
out
what
really
is
going
on
are
so
absurdly
remote
that
the
only
thing
to
do
is
to
say
hang
the
sense
of
it
and
just
keep
yourself
occupied
look
at
me
i
design
coastlines
i
got
an
award
for
norway
he
rummaged
around
in
a
pile
of
debris
and
pulled
out
a
large
perspex
block
with
his
name
on
it
and
a
model
of
norway
moulded
into
it
where's
the
sense
in
that
he
said
none
that
i've
been
able
to
make
out
i've
been
doing
fjords
in
all
my
life
for
a
fleeting
moment
they
become
fashionable
and
i
get
a
major
award
he
turned
it
over
in
his
hands
with
a
shrug
and
tossed
it
aside
carelessly
but
not
so
carelessly
that
it
didn't
land
on
something
soft
in
this
replacement
earth
we're
building
they've
given
me
africa
to
do
and
of
course
i'm
doing
it
with
all
fjords
again
because
i
happen
to
like
them
and
i'm
old
fashioned
enough
to
think
that
they
give
a
lovely
baroque
feel
to
a
continent
and
they
tell
me
it's
not
equatorial
enough
equatorial
he
gave
a
hollow
laugh
what
does
it
matter
science
has
achieved
some
wonderful
things
of
course
but
i'd
far
rather
be
happy
than
right
any
day
and
are
you
no
that's
where
it
all
falls
down
of
course
pity
said
arthur
with
sympathy
it
sounded
like
quite
a
good
lifestyle
otherwise
somewhere
on
the
wall
a
small
white
light
flashed
come
said
slartibartfast
you
are
to
meet
the
mice
your
arrival
on
the
planet
has
caused
considerable
excitement
it
has
already
been
hailed
so
i
gather
as
the
third
most
improbable
event
in
the
history
of
the
universe
what
were
the
first
two
oh
probably
just
coincidences
said
slartibartfast
carelessly
he
opened
the
door
and
stood
waiting
for
arthur
to
follow
arthur
glanced
around
him
once
more
and
then
down
at
himself
at
the
sweaty
dishevelled
clothes
he
had
been
lying
in
the
mud
in
on
thursday
morning
i
seem
to
be
having
tremendous
difficulty
with
my
lifestyle
he
muttered
to
himself
i
beg
your
pardon
said
the
old
man
mildly
oh
nothing
said
arthur
only
joking
chapter
it
is
of
course
well
known
that
careless
talk
costs
lives
but
the
full
scale
of
the
problem
is
not
always
appreciated
for
instance
at
the
very
moment
that
arthur
said
i
seem
to
be
having
tremendous
difficulty
with
my
lifestyle
a
freak
wormhole
opened
up
in
the
fabric
of
the
spacetime
continuum
and
carried
his
words
far
far
back
in
time
across
almost
infinite
reaches
of
space
to
a
distant
galaxy
where
strange
and
warlike
beings
were
poised
on
the
brink
of
frightful
interstellar
battle
the
two
opposing
leaders
were
meeting
for
the
last
time
a
dreadful
silence
fell
across
the
conference
table
as
the
commander
of
the
vl'hurgs
resplendent
in
his
black
jewelled
battle
shorts
gazed
levelly
at
the
g'gugvuntt
leader
squatting
opposite
him
in
a
cloud
of
green
sweetsmelling
steam
and
with
a
million
sleek
and
horribly
beweaponed
star
cruisers
poised
to
unleash
electric
death
at
his
single
word
of
command
challenged
the
vile
creature
to
take
back
what
it
had
said
about
his
mother
the
creature
stirred
in
his
sickly
broiling
vapour
and
at
that
very
moment
the
words
i
seem
to
be
having
tremendous
difficulty
with
my
lifestyle
drifted
across
the
conference
table
unfortunately
in
the
vl'hurg
tongue
this
was
the
most
dreadful
insult
imaginable
and
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
wage
terrible
war
for
centuries
eventually
of
course
after
their
galaxy
had
been
decimated
over
a
few
thousand
years
it
was
realized
that
the
whole
thing
had
been
a
ghastly
mistake
and
so
the
two
opposing
battle
fleets
settled
their
few
remaining
differences
in
order
to
launch
a
joint
attack
on
our
own
galaxy
now
positively
identified
as
the
source
of
the
offending
remark
for
thousands
more
years
the
mighty
ships
tore
across
the
empty
wastes
of
space
and
finally
dived
screaming
on
to
the
first
planet
they
came
across
which
happened
to
be
the
earth
where
due
to
a
terrible
miscalculation
of
scale
the
entire
battle
fleet
was
accidentally
swallowed
by
a
small
dog
those
who
study
the
complex
interplay
of
cause
and
effect
in
the
history
of
the
universe
say
that
this
sort
of
thing
is
going
on
all
the
time
but
that
we
are
powerless
to
prevent
it
it's
just
life
they
say
a
short
aircar
trip
brought
arthur
and
the
old
magrathean
to
a
doorway
they
left
the
car
and
went
through
the
door
into
a
waiting
room
full
of
glasstopped
tables
and
perspex
awards
almost
immediately
a
light
flashed
above
the
door
at
the
other
side
of
the
room
and
they
entered
arthur
you're
safe
a
voice
cried
am
i
said
arthur
rather
startled
oh
good
the
lighting
was
rather
subdued
and
it
took
him
a
moment
or
so
to
see
ford
trillian
and
zaphod
sitting
round
a
large
table
beautifully
decked
out
with
exotic
dishes
strange
sweetmeats
and
bizarre
fruits
they
were
stuffing
their
faces
what
happened
to
you
demanded
arthur
well
said
zaphod
attacking
a
boneful
of
grilled
muscle
our
guests
here
have
been
gassing
us
and
zapping
our
minds
and
being
generally
weird
and
have
now
given
us
a
rather
nice
meal
to
make
it
up
to
us
here
he
said
hoiking
out
a
lump
of
evil
smelling
meat
from
a
bowl
have
some
vegan
rhino's
cutlet
it's
delicious
if
you
happen
to
like
that
sort
of
thing
hosts
said
arthur
what
hosts
i
don't
see
any
a
small
voice
said
welcome
to
lunch
earth
creature
arthur
glanced
around
and
suddenly
yelped
ugh
he
said
there
are
mice
on
the
table
there
was
an
awkward
silence
as
everyone
looked
pointedly
at
arthur
he
was
busy
staring
at
two
white
mice
sitting
in
what
looked
like
whisky
glasses
on
the
table
he
heard
the
silence
and
glanced
around
at
everyone
oh
he
said
with
sudden
realization
oh
i'm
sorry
i
wasn't
quite
prepared
for
let
me
introduce
you
said
trillian
arthur
this
is
benji
mouse
hi
said
one
of
the
mice
his
whiskers
stroked
what
must
have
been
a
touch
sensitive
panel
on
the
inside
of
the
whiskyglass
like
affair
and
it
moved
forward
slightly
and
this
is
frankie
mouse
the
other
mouse
said
pleased
to
meet
you
and
did
likewise
arthur
gaped
but
aren't
they
yes
said
trillian
they
are
the
mice
i
brought
with
me
from
the
earth
she
looked
him
in
the
eye
and
arthur
thought
he
detected
the
tiniest
resigned
shrug
could
you
pass
me
that
bowl
of
grated
arcturan
megadonkey
she
said
slartibartfast
coughed
politely
er
excuse
me
he
said
yes
thank
you
slartibartfast
said
benji
mouse
sharply
you
may
go
what
oh
er
very
well
said
the
old
man
slightly
taken
aback
i'll
just
go
and
get
on
with
some
of
my
fjords
then
ah
well
in
fact
that
won't
be
necessary
said
frankie
mouse
it
looks
very
much
as
if
we
won't
be
needing
the
new
earth
any
longer
he
swivelled
his
pink
little
eyes
not
now
that
we
have
found
a
native
of
the
planet
who
was
there
seconds
before
it
was
destroyed
what
cried
slartibartfast
aghast
you
can't
mean
that
i've
got
a
thousand
glaciers
poised
and
ready
to
roll
over
africa
well
perhaps
you
can
take
a
quick
skiing
holiday
before
you
dismantle
them
said
frankie
acidly
skiing
holiday
cried
the
old
man
those
glaciers
are
works
of
art
elegantly
sculptured
contours
soaring
pinnacles
of
ice
deep
majestic
ravines
it
would
be
sacrilege
to
go
skiing
on
high
art
thank
you
slartibartfast
said
benji
firmly
that
will
be
all
yes
sir
said
the
old
man
coldly
thank
you
very
much
well
goodbye
earthman
he
said
to
arthur
hope
the
lifestyle
comes
together
with
a
brief
nod
to
the
rest
of
the
company
he
turned
and
walked
sadly
out
of
the
room
arthur
stared
after
him
not
knowing
what
to
say
now
said
benji
mouse
to
business
ford
and
zaphod
clinked
their
glasses
together
to
business
they
said
i
beg
your
pardon
said
benji
ford
looked
round
sorry
i
thought
you
were
proposing
a
toast
he
said
the
two
mice
scuttled
impatiently
around
in
their
glass
transports
finally
they
composed
themselves
and
benji
moved
forward
to
address
arthur
now
earth
creature
he
said
the
situation
we
have
in
effect
is
this
we
have
as
you
know
been
more
or
less
running
your
planet
for
the
last
ten
million
years
in
order
to
find
this
wretched
thing
called
the
ultimate
question
why
said
arthur
sharply
no
we
already
thought
of
that
one
said
frankie
interrupting
but
it
doesn't
fit
the
answer
why
fortytwo
you
see
it
doesn't
work
no
said
arthur
i
mean
why
have
you
been
doing
it
oh
i
see
said
frankie
well
eventually
just
habit
i
think
to
be
brutally
honest
and
this
is
more
or
less
the
point
we're
sick
to
the
teeth
with
the
whole
thing
and
the
prospect
of
doing
it
all
over
again
on
account
of
those
whinnetridden
vogons
quite
frankly
gives
me
the
screaming
heeby
jeebies
you
know
what
i
mean
it
was
by
the
merest
lucky
chance
that
benji
and
i
finished
our
particular
job
and
left
the
planet
early
for
a
quick
holiday
and
have
since
manipulated
our
way
back
to
magrathea
by
the
good
offices
of
your
friends
magrathea
is
a
gateway
back
to
our
own
dimension
put
in
benji
since
when
continued
his
murine
colleague
we
have
had
an
offer
of
a
quite
enormously
fat
contract
to
do
the
d
chat
show
and
lecture
circuit
back
in
our
own
dimensional
neck
of
the
woods
and
we're
very
much
inclined
to
take
it
i
would
wouldn't
you
ford
said
zaphod
promptingly
oh
yes
said
ford
jump
at
it
like
a
shot
arthur
glanced
at
them
wondering
what
all
this
was
leading
up
to
but
we've
got
to
have
a
product
you
see
said
frankie
i
mean
ideally
we
still
need
the
ultimate
question
in
some
form
or
other
zaphod
leaned
forward
to
arthur
you
see
he
said
if
they're
just
sitting
there
in
the
studio
looking
very
relaxed
and
you
know
just
mentioning
that
they
happen
to
know
the
answer
to
life
the
universe
and
everything
and
then
eventually
have
to
admit
that
in
fact
it's
fortytwo
then
the
show's
probably
quite
short
no
followup
you
see
we
have
to
have
something
that
sounds
good
said
benji
something
that
sounds
good
exclaimed
arthur
an
ultimate
question
that
sounds
good
from
a
couple
of
mice
the
mice
bristled
well
i
mean
yes
idealism
yes
the
dignity
of
pure
research
yes
the
pursuit
of
truth
in
all
its
forms
but
there
comes
a
point
i'm
afraid
where
you
begin
to
suspect
that
if
there's
any
real
truth
it's
that
the
entire
multidimensional
infinity
of
the
universe
is
almost
certainly
being
run
by
a
bunch
of
maniacs
and
if
it
comes
to
a
choice
between
spending
yet
another
ten
million
years
finding
that
out
and
on
the
other
hand
just
taking
the
money
and
running
then
i
for
one
could
do
with
the
exercise
said
frankie
but
started
arthur
hopelessly
hey
will
you
get
this
earthman
interrupted
zaphod
you
are
a
last
generation
product
of
that
computer
matrix
right
and
you
were
there
right
up
to
the
moment
your
planet
got
the
finger
yeah
er
so
your
brain
was
an
organic
part
of
the
penultimate
configuration
of
the
computer
programme
said
ford
rather
lucidly
he
thought
right
said
zaphod
well
said
arthur
doubtfully
he
wasn't
aware
of
ever
having
felt
an
organic
part
of
anything
he
had
always
seen
this
as
one
of
his
problems
in
other
words
said
benji
steering
his
curious
little
vehicle
right
over
to
arthur
there's
a
good
chance
that
the
structure
of
the
question
is
encoded
in
the
structure
of
your
brain
so
we
want
to
buy
it
off
you
what
the
question
said
arthur
yes
said
ford
and
trillian
for
lots
of
money
said
zaphod
no
no
said
frankie
it's
the
brain
we
want
to
buy
what
i
thought
you
said
you
could
just
read
his
brain
electronically
protested
ford
oh
yes
said
frankie
but
we'd
have
to
get
it
out
first
it's
got
to
be
prepared
treated
said
benji
diced
thank
you
shouted
arthur
tipping
up
his
chair
and
backing
away
from
the
table
in
horror
it
could
always
be
replaced
said
benji
reasonably
if
you
think
it's
important
yes
an
electronic
brain
said
frankie
a
simple
one
would
suffice
a
simple
one
wailed
arthur
yeah
said
zaphod
with
a
sudden
evil
grin
you'd
just
have
to
program
it
to
say
what
and
i
don't
understand
and
where's
the
tea
who'd
know
the
difference
what
cried
arthur
backing
away
still
further
see
what
i
mean
said
zaphod
and
howled
with
pain
because
of
something
that
trillian
did
at
that
moment
i'd
notice
the
difference
said
arthur
no
you
wouldn't
said
frankie
mouse
you'd
be
programmed
not
to
ford
made
for
the
door
look
i'm
sorry
mice
old
lads
he
said
i
don't
think
we've
got
a
deal
i
rather
think
we
have
to
have
a
deal
said
the
mice
in
chorus
all
the
charm
vanishing
fro
their
piping
little
voices
in
an
instant
with
a
tiny
whining
shriek
their
two
glass
transports
lifted
themselves
off
the
table
and
swung
through
the
air
towards
arthur
who
stumbled
further
backwards
into
a
blind
corner
utterly
unable
to
cope
or
think
of
anything
trillian
grabbed
him
desperately
by
the
arm
and
tried
to
drag
him
towards
the
door
which
ford
and
zaphod
were
struggling
to
open
but
arthur
was
dead
weight
he
seemed
hypnotized
by
the
airborne
rodents
swooping
towards
him
she
screamed
at
him
but
he
just
gaped
with
one
more
yank
ford
and
zaphod
got
the
door
open
on
the
other
side
of
it
was
a
small
pack
of
rather
ugly
men
who
they
could
only
assume
were
the
heavy
mob
of
magrathea
not
only
were
they
ugly
themselves
but
the
medical
equipment
they
carried
with
them
was
also
far
from
pretty
they
charged
so
arthur
was
about
to
have
his
head
cut
open
trillian
was
unable
to
help
him
and
ford
and
zaphod
were
about
to
be
set
upon
by
several
thugs
a
great
deal
heavier
and
more
sharply
armed
than
they
were
all
in
all
it
was
extremely
fortunate
that
at
that
moment
every
alarm
on
the
planet
burst
into
an
earsplitting
din
chapter
emergency
emergency
blared
the
klaxons
throughout
magrathea
hostile
ship
has
landed
on
planet
armed
intruders
in
section
a
defence
stations
defence
stations
the
two
mice
sniffed
irritably
round
the
fragments
of
their
glass
transports
where
they
lay
shattered
on
the
floor
damnation
muttered
frankie
mouse
all
that
fuss
over
two
pounds
of
earthling
brain
he
scuttled
round
and
about
his
pink
eyes
flashing
his
fine
white
coat
bristling
with
static
the
only
thing
we
can
do
now
said
benji
crouching
and
stroking
his
whiskers
in
thought
is
to
try
and
fake
a
question
invent
one
that
will
sound
plausible
difficult
said
frankie
he
thought
how
about
what's
yellow
and
dangerous
benji
considered
this
for
a
moment
no
no
good
he
said
doesn't
fit
the
answer
they
sank
into
silence
for
a
few
seconds
alright
said
benji
what
do
you
get
if
you
multiply
six
by
seven
no
no
too
literal
too
factual
said
frankie
wouldn't
sustain
the
punters
interest
again
they
thought
then
frankie
said
here's
a
thought
how
many
roads
must
a
man
walk
down
ah
said
benji
aha
now
that
does
sound
promising
he
rolled
the
phrase
around
a
little
yes
he
said
that's
excellent
sounds
very
significant
without
actually
tying
you
down
to
meaning
anything
at
all
how
many
roads
must
a
man
walk
down
fortytwo
excellent
excellent
that'll
fox
em
frankie
baby
we
are
made
they
performed
a
scampering
dance
in
their
excitement
near
them
on
the
floor
lay
several
rather
ugly
men
who
had
been
hit
about
the
head
with
some
heavy
design
awards
half
a
mile
away
four
figures
pounded
up
a
corridor
looking
for
a
way
out
they
emerged
into
a
wide
openplan
computer
bay
they
glanced
about
wildly
which
way
do
you
reckon
zaphod
said
ford
at
a
wild
guess
i'd
say
down
here
said
zaphod
running
off
down
to
the
right
between
a
computer
bank
and
the
wall
as
the
others
started
after
him
he
was
brought
up
short
by
a
killozap
energy
bolt
that
cracked
through
the
air
inches
in
front
of
him
and
fried
a
small
section
of
adjacent
wall
a
voice
on
a
loud
hailer
said
ok
beeblebrox
hold
it
right
there
we've
got
you
covered
cops
hissed
zaphod
and
span
around
in
a
crouch
you
want
to
try
a
guess
at
all
ford
ok
this
way
said
ford
and
the
four
of
them
ran
down
a
gangway
between
two
computer
banks
at
the
end
of
the
gangway
appeared
a
heavily
armoured
and
space
suited
figure
waving
a
vicious
killozap
gun
we
don't
want
to
shoot
you
beeblebrox
shouted
the
figure
suits
me
fine
shouted
zaphod
back
and
dived
down
a
wide
gap
between
two
data
process
units
the
others
swerved
in
behind
him
there
are
two
of
them
said
trillian
we're
cornered
they
squeezed
themselves
down
in
an
angle
between
a
large
computer
data
bank
and
the
wall
they
held
their
breath
and
waited
suddenly
the
air
exploded
with
energy
bolts
as
both
the
cops
opened
fire
on
them
simultaneously
hey
they're
shooting
at
us
said
arthur
crouching
in
a
tight
ball
i
thought
they
said
they
didn't
want
to
do
that
yeah
i
thought
they
said
that
agreed
ford
zaphod
stuck
a
head
up
for
a
dangerous
moment
hey
he
said
i
thought
you
said
you
didn't
want
to
shoot
us
and
ducked
again
they
waited
after
a
moment
a
voice
replied
it
isn't
easy
being
a
cop
what
did
he
say
whispered
ford
in
astonishment
he
said
it
isn't
easy
being
a
cop
well
surely
that's
his
problem
isn't
it
i'd
have
thought
so
ford
shouted
out
hey
listen
i
think
we've
got
enough
problems
on
our
own
having
you
shooting
at
us
so
if
you
could
avoid
laying
your
problems
on
us
as
well
i
think
we'd
all
find
it
easier
to
cope
another
pause
and
then
the
loud
hailer
again
now
see
here
guy
said
the
voice
on
the
loud
hailer
you're
not
dealing
with
any
dumb
twobit
triggerpumping
morons
with
low
hairlines
little
piggy
eyes
and
no
conversation
we're
a
couple
of
intelligent
caring
guys
that
you'd
probably
quite
like
if
you
met
us
socially
i
don't
go
around
gratuitously
shooting
people
and
then
bragging
about
it
afterwards
in
seedy
spacerangers
bars
like
some
cops
i
could
mention
i
go
around
shooting
people
gratuitously
and
then
i
agonize
about
it
afterwards
for
hours
to
my
girlfriend
and
i
write
novels
chimed
in
the
other
cop
though
i
haven't
had
any
of
them
published
yet
so
i
better
warn
you
i'm
in
a
meeeean
mood
ford's
eyes
popped
halfway
out
of
their
sockets
who
are
these
guys
he
said
dunno
said
zaphod
i
think
i
preferred
it
when
they
were
shooting
so
are
you
going
to
come
quietly
shouted
one
of
the
cops
again
or
are
you
going
to
let
us
blast
you
out
which
would
you
prefer
shouted
ford
a
millisecond
later
the
air
about
them
started
to
fry
again
as
bolt
after
bolt
of
killozap
hurled
itself
into
the
computer
bank
in
front
of
them
the
fusillade
continued
for
several
seconds
at
unbearable
intensity
when
it
stopped
there
were
a
few
seconds
of
near
quietness
ad
the
echoes
died
away
you
still
there
called
one
of
the
cops
yes
they
called
back
we
didn't
enjoy
doing
that
at
all
shouted
the
other
cop
we
could
tell
shouted
ford
now
listen
to
this
beeblebrox
and
you
better
listen
good
why
shouted
back
zaphod
because
shouted
the
cop
it's
going
to
be
very
intelligent
and
quite
interesting
and
humane
now
either
you
all
give
yourselves
up
now
and
let
us
beat
you
up
a
bit
though
not
very
much
of
course
because
we
are
firmly
opposed
to
needless
violence
or
we
blow
up
this
entire
planet
and
possibly
one
or
two
others
we
noticed
on
our
way
out
here
but
that's
crazy
cried
trillian
you
wouldn't
do
that
oh
yes
we
would
shouted
the
cop
wouldn't
we
he
asked
the
other
one
oh
yes
we'd
have
to
no
question
the
other
one
called
back
but
why
demanded
trillian
because
there
are
some
things
you
have
to
do
even
if
you
are
an
enlightened
liberal
cop
who
knows
all
about
sensitivity
and
everything
i
just
don't
believe
these
guys
muttered
ford
shaking
his
head
one
cop
shouted
to
the
other
shall
we
shoot
them
again
for
a
bit
yeah
why
not
they
let
fly
another
electric
barrage
the
heat
and
noise
was
quite
fantastic
slowly
the
computer
bank
was
beginning
to
disintegrate
the
front
had
almost
all
melted
away
and
thick
rivulets
of
molten
metal
were
winding
their
way
back
towards
where
they
were
squatting
they
huddled
further
back
and
waited
for
the
end
chapter
but
the
end
never
came
at
least
not
then
quite
suddenly
the
barrage
stopped
and
the
sudden
silence
afterwards
was
punctuated
by
a
couple
of
strangled
gurgles
and
thuds
the
four
stared
at
each
other
what
happened
said
arthur
they
stopped
said
zaphod
with
a
shrug
why
dunno
do
you
want
to
go
and
ask
them
no
they
waited
hello
called
out
ford
no
answer
that's
odd
perhaps
it's
a
trap
they
haven't
the
wit
what
were
those
thuds
dunno
they
waited
for
a
few
more
seconds
right
said
ford
i'm
going
to
have
a
look
he
glanced
round
at
the
others
is
no
one
going
to
say
no
you
can't
possibly
let
me
go
instead
they
all
shook
their
heads
oh
well
he
said
and
stood
up
for
a
moment
nothing
happened
then
after
a
second
or
so
nothing
continued
to
happen
ford
peered
through
the
thick
smoke
that
was
billowing
out
of
the
burning
computer
cautiously
he
stepped
out
into
the
open
still
nothing
happened
twenty
yards
away
he
could
dimly
see
through
the
smoke
the
spacesuited
figure
of
one
of
the
cops
he
was
lying
in
a
crumpled
heap
on
the
ground
twenty
yards
in
the
other
direction
lay
the
second
man
no
one
else
was
anywhere
to
be
seen
this
struck
ford
as
being
extremely
odd
slowly
nervously
he
walked
towards
the
first
one
the
body
lay
reassuringly
still
as
he
approached
it
and
continued
to
lie
reassuringly
still
as
he
reached
it
and
put
his
foot
down
on
the
killozap
gun
that
still
dangled
from
its
limp
fingers
he
reached
down
and
picked
it
up
meeting
no
resistance
the
cop
was
quite
clearly
dead
a
quick
examination
revealed
him
to
be
from
blagulon
kappa
he
was
a
methanebreathing
life
form
dependent
on
his
space
suit
for
survival
in
the
thin
oxygen
atmosphere
of
magrathea
the
tiny
lifesupport
system
computer
on
his
backpack
appeared
unexpectedly
to
have
blown
up
ford
poked
around
in
it
in
considerable
astonishment
these
miniature
suit
computers
usually
had
the
full
backup
of
the
main
computer
back
on
the
ship
with
which
they
were
directly
linked
through
the
subetha
such
a
system
was
failsafe
in
all
circumstances
other
than
total
feedback
malfunction
which
was
unheard
of
he
hurried
over
to
the
other
prone
figure
and
discovered
that
exactly
the
same
impossible
thing
had
happened
to
him
presumably
simultaneously
he
called
the
others
over
to
look
they
came
shared
his
astonishment
but
not
his
curiosity
let's
get
shot
out
of
this
hole
said
zaphod
if
whatever
i'm
supposed
to
be
looking
for
is
here
i
don't
want
it
he
grabbed
the
second
killozap
gun
blasted
a
perfectly
harmless
accounting
computer
and
rushed
out
into
the
corridor
followed
by
the
others
he
very
nearly
blasted
hell
out
of
an
aircar
that
stood
waiting
for
them
a
few
yards
away
the
aircar
was
empty
but
arthur
recognized
it
as
belonging
to
slartibartfast
it
had
a
note
from
him
pinned
to
part
of
its
sparse
instrument
panel
the
note
had
an
arrow
drawn
on
it
pointing
at
one
of
the
controls
it
said
this
is
probably
the
best
button
to
press
chapter
the
aircar
rocketed
them
at
speeds
in
excess
of
r
through
the
steel
tunnels
that
lead
out
onto
the
appalling
surface
of
the
planet
which
was
now
in
the
grip
of
yet
another
drear
morning
twilight
ghastly
grey
lights
congealed
on
the
land
r
is
a
velocity
measure
defined
as
a
reasonable
speed
of
travel
that
is
consistent
with
health
mental
wellbeing
and
not
being
more
than
say
five
minutes
late
it
is
therefore
clearly
an
almost
infinitely
variable
figure
according
to
circumstances
since
the
first
two
factors
vary
not
only
with
speed
taken
as
an
absolute
but
also
with
awareness
of
the
third
factor
unless
handled
with
tranquility
this
equation
can
result
in
considerable
stress
ulcers
and
even
death
r
is
not
a
fixed
velocity
but
it
is
clearly
far
too
fast
the
aircar
flung
itself
through
the
air
at
r
and
above
deposited
them
next
to
the
heart
of
gold
which
stood
starkly
on
the
frozen
ground
like
a
bleached
bone
and
then
precipitately
hurled
itself
back
in
the
direction
whence
they
had
come
presumably
on
important
business
of
its
own
shivering
the
four
of
them
stood
and
looked
at
the
ship
beside
it
stood
another
one
it
was
the
blagulon
kappa
policecraft
a
bulbous
sharklike
affair
slate
green
in
colour
and
smothered
with
black
stencilled
letters
of
varying
degrees
of
size
and
unfriendliness
the
letters
informed
anyone
who
cared
to
read
them
as
to
where
the
ship
was
from
what
section
of
the
police
it
was
assigned
to
and
where
the
power
feeds
should
be
connected
it
seemed
somehow
unnaturally
dark
and
silent
even
for
a
ship
whose
twoman
crew
was
at
that
moment
lying
asphyxicated
in
a
smokefilled
chamber
several
miles
beneath
the
ground
it
is
one
of
those
curious
things
that
is
impossible
to
explain
or
define
but
one
can
sense
when
a
ship
is
completely
dead
ford
could
sense
it
and
found
it
most
mysterious
a
ship
and
two
policemen
seemed
to
have
gone
spontaneously
dead
in
his
experience
the
universe
simply
didn't
work
like
that
the
other
three
could
sense
it
too
but
they
could
sense
the
bitter
cold
even
more
and
hurried
back
into
the
heart
of
gold
suffering
from
an
acute
attack
of
no
curiosity
ford
stayed
and
went
to
examine
the
blagulon
ship
as
he
walked
he
nearly
tripped
over
an
inert
steel
figure
lying
face
down
in
the
cold
dust
marvin
he
exclaimed
what
are
you
doing
don't
feel
you
have
to
take
any
notice
of
me
please
came
a
muffled
drone
but
how
are
you
metalman
said
ford
very
depressed
what's
up
i
don't
know
said
marvin
i've
never
been
there
why
said
ford
squatting
down
beside
him
and
shivering
are
you
lying
face
down
in
the
dust
it's
a
very
effective
way
of
being
wretched
said
marvin
don't
pretend
you
want
to
talk
to
me
i
know
you
hate
me
no
i
don't
yes
you
do
everybody
does
it's
part
of
the
shape
of
the
universe
i
only
have
to
talk
to
somebody
and
they
begin
to
hate
me
even
robots
hate
me
if
you
just
ignore
me
i
expect
i
shall
probably
go
away
he
jacked
himself
up
to
his
feet
and
stood
resolutely
facing
the
opposite
direction
that
ship
hated
me
he
said
dejectedly
indicating
the
policecraft
that
ship
said
ford
in
sudden
excitement
what
happened
to
it
do
you
know
it
hated
me
because
i
talked
to
it
you
talked
to
it
exclaimed
ford
what
do
you
mean
you
talked
to
it
simple
i
got
very
bored
and
depressed
so
i
went
and
plugged
myself
in
to
its
external
computer
feed
i
talked
to
the
computer
at
great
length
and
explained
my
view
of
the
universe
to
it
said
marvin
and
what
happened
pressed
ford
it
committed
suicide
said
marvin
and
stalked
off
back
to
the
heart
of
gold
chapter
that
night
as
the
heart
of
gold
was
busy
putting
a
few
light
years
between
itself
and
the
horsehead
nebula
zaphod
lounged
under
the
small
palm
tree
on
the
bridge
trying
to
bang
his
brain
into
shape
with
massive
pan
galactic
gargle
blasters
ford
and
trillian
sat
in
a
corner
discussing
life
and
matters
arising
from
it
and
arthur
took
to
his
bed
to
flip
through
ford's
copy
of
the
hitch
hiker's
guide
to
the
galaxy
since
he
was
going
to
live
in
the
place
he
reasoned
he'd
better
start
finding
out
something
about
it
he
came
across
this
entry
it
said
the
history
of
every
major
galactic
civilization
tends
to
pass
through
three
distinct
and
recognizable
phases
those
of
survival
inquiry
and
sophistication
otherwise
known
as
the
how
why
and
where
phases
for
instance
the
first
phase
is
characterized
by
the
question
how
can
we
eat
the
second
by
the
question
why
do
we
eat
and
the
third
by
the
question
where
shall
we
have
lunch
he
got
no
further
before
the
ship's
intercom
buzzed
into
life
hey
earthman
you
hungry
kid
said
zaphod's
voice
er
well
yes
a
little
peckish
i
suppose
said
arthur
ok
baby
hold
tight
said
zaphod
we'll
take
in
a
quick
bite
at
the
restaurant
at
the
end
of
the
universe

president
full
title
president
of
the
imperial
galactic
government
the
term
imperial
is
kept
though
it
is
now
an
anachronism
the
hereditary
emperor
is
nearly
dead
and
has
been
so
for
many
centuries
in
the
last
moments
of
his
dying
coma
he
was
locked
in
a
statis
field
which
keeps
him
in
a
state
of
perpetual
unchangingness
all
his
heirs
are
now
long
dead
and
this
means
that
without
any
drastic
political
upheaval
power
has
simply
and
effectively
moved
a
rung
or
two
down
the
ladder
and
is
now
seen
to
be
vested
in
a
body
which
used
to
act
simply
as
advisers
to
the
emperor
an
elected
governmental
assembly
headed
by
a
president
elected
by
that
assembly
in
fact
it
vests
in
no
such
place
the
president
in
particular
is
very
much
a
figurehead
he
wields
no
real
power
whatsoever
he
is
apparently
chosen
by
the
government
but
the
qualities
he
is
required
to
display
are
not
those
of
leadership
but
those
of
finely
judged
outrage
for
this
reason
the
president
is
always
a
controversial
choice
always
an
infuriating
but
fascinating
character
his
job
is
not
to
wield
power
but
to
draw
attention
away
from
it
on
those
criteria
zaphod
beeblebrox
is
one
of
the
most
successful
presidents
the
galaxy
has
ever
had
he
has
already
spent
two
of
his
ten
presidential
years
in
prison
for
fraud
very
very
few
people
realize
that
the
president
and
the
government
have
virtually
no
power
at
all
and
of
these
very
few
people
only
six
know
whence
ultimate
political
power
is
wielded
most
of
the
others
secretly
believe
that
the
ultimate
decisionmaking
process
is
handled
by
a
computer
they
couldn't
be
more
wrong
ford
prefect's
original
name
is
only
pronuncible
in
an
obscure
betelgeusian
dialect
now
virtually
extinct
since
the
great
collapsing
hrung
disaster
of
galsidyear
which
wiped
out
all
the
old
praxibetel
communities
on
betelgeuse
seven
ford's
father
was
the
only
man
on
the
entire
planet
to
survive
the
great
collapsing
hrung
disaster
by
an
extraordinary
coincidence
that
he
was
never
able
satisfactorily
to
explain
the
whole
episode
is
shrouded
in
deep
mystery
in
fact
no
one
ever
knew
what
a
hrung
was
nor
why
it
had
chosen
to
collapse
on
betelgeuse
seven
particularly
ford's
father
magnanimously
waving
aside
the
clouds
of
suspicion
that
had
inevitably
settled
around
him
came
to
live
on
betelgeuse
five
where
he
both
fathered
and
uncled
ford
in
memory
of
his
now
dead
race
he
christened
him
in
the
ancient
praxibetel
tongue
because
ford
never
learned
to
say
his
original
name
his
father
eventually
died
of
shame
which
is
still
a
terminal
disease
in
some
parts
of
the
galaxy
the
other
kids
at
school
nicknamed
him
ix
which
in
the
language
of
betelgeuse
five
translates
as
boy
who
is
not
able
satisfactorily
to
explain
what
a
hrung
is
nor
why
it
should
choose
to
collapse
on
betelgeuse
seven
